This page lists resources that this course draws on frequently or at
least occasionally. For a more extensive list of data science resources,
see the [**General Resources**](General_Resources.qmd) page.

All materials described below are (should be) freely available online.
If you can't get to them, let me know. Note that a lot of the listed
resources are dynamic and ever changing. That means occasionally links
might not work, sites go offline, chapters in online books get
re-arranged, etc. If you notice anything that's not quite right, please
let me know.

# Books and online tutorials

-   [**Introduction to Data
    Science (IDS**](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/) is the book I'll refer
    to a good bit in the 1st part of the course.
-   [**R for Data Science (R4DS)** (2nd
    edition)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/). This book will also be mentioned
    frequently. It is a very gentle and good introduction to data
    science in R. It has a lot of good exercises [and
    solutions.](https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/r4ds-solutions/)
    Note that most of the course material was written when only the [1st
    edition](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) existed. I've tried to update
    references to specific chapters/pages of R4DS on this website, but
    it could be that there is still the occasional pointer to something
    in the 1st edition. If you find such outdated references/links,
    please let me know so I can fix.
-   [**he Art of Data
    Science (ADS)**](https://leanpub.com/artofdatascience) has some good
    big-picture, introductory level chapters on different aspects of a
    data analysis. It is a *pay what you want* book with a minimum price
    of zero, which means you can get it for free (note that the book +
    video bundle has a non-zero minimum price). (I heard that sometimes,
    once you register, the email with the book link goes to the spam
    folder, make sure to check there.)
-   [**An Introduction to Statistical Learning (with R) (ISL)**](https://statlearning.com/) is a good introduction to the
    statistical and machine learning (i.e. model fitting) part of the
    data analysis workflow. I'll refer to it frequently in the second
    part of the course. While we won't work through the exercises/labs
    that are part of ISL, if you are interested in trying out some of
    those, [Emil Hvitfeldt's
    website](https://emilhvitfeldt.github.io/ISLR-tidymodels-labs/index.html)
    does the labs using the `tidymodels` set of packages, which we will
    also be using in this course.
-   [**Hands-on Machine Learning with R (HMLR)**](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/) covers somewhat similar
    material as ISL, but with different emphasis and a different
    approach. I refer to it in several of the later course modules.
-   [**Feature Engineering and
    Selection (FES)**](https://bookdown.org/max/FES/) focuses on a specific
    aspect of the data analysis workflow and is a good resource for
    those topics.
-   [**happygitwitR (HGR)**](https://happygitwithr.com/) is a good
    resource to learn some of the basics of Git/Github with R.
-   [**Posit Recipes (PR)**](https://posit.cloud/learn/recipes) are
    a great source for short code examples to do common tasks. 

# Tools

-   We'll be using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [R Studio
    Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). The [R
    and R Studio
    document](../modules/module_intro_tools/Tools_RandRStudio.qmd) has
    details.
-   We will also be using [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and
    [GitHub](https://github.com/). You need to get that software and a
    GitHub user account. I also recommend/assume you are using the
    [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) client (but you don't have
    to). See the [**GitHub introduction
    document**](../modules/module_intro_tools/Tools_Github_Introduction.qmd)
    for details.

# Important notes

-   The company now called
    **Posit** was called **R Studio**. You will likely see the old label
    show up. The **software editor** we use for writing R code is still called R
    Studio.
-   **Quarto** is fairly new, in the past we used **R Markdown** instead. You will likely see references to **R
    Markdown**. Just think of it as now being Quarto (i.e. instead of
    `.Rmd` files we now work with `.qmd` files). They are very similar, Quarto is basically the newer version of R Markdown. R Markdown still works, but Quarto is more powerful, so it's the better option to use/learn it.

# General help

-   The main place to get any course specific help are our course
    discussion boards. Use them widely to ask questions, to answer
    others' questions, to post links to interesting resources, etc.
-   Most questions you will have are likely not course specific, but
    will have to do with R/Github/RMarkdown/etc. For that, Google will
    be your best friend. Most of the time, someone had the same
    problem/question you do and someone else answered it. The only
    tricky thing is finding that post. Even after years of doing this, I
    probably google how to do something in R every day ðŸ˜ƒ.
-   When you search online for help, quite often you land on some
    [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/) site (often [Stack
    Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)). These are a [collection of
    widely-used online question and answer
    sites](https://stackexchange.com/sites) covering all kinds of topics
    (including R, Github, Data Analysis, etc.). The majority of the
    time, you will find an answer, or at least something that gets you
    closer, on those sites. I rarely go to those sites directly, instead
    I type my query into Google and it often sends me to one of the
    StackExchange sites.
-   The [Posit community](https://community.rstudio.com/) is another
    good place to ask questions. It is not as widely used as
    StackExchange, but it seems to be more newcomer friendly. I haven't
    used it much.
-   Another highly recommended resource is the [R for Data Science
    learning community](https://www.rfordatasci.com/). They have a Slack
    workspace which you can join for free and ask questions about R,
    Data Science and related topics. They are very newbie-friendly. I
    have not used them much but they seem to respond fairly quickly and
    are helpful.

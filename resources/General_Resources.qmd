title: More Data Science Resources
subtitle: ""
---

I kept adding resources until things got too unwieldy and the *Course
Resources* page was becoming too large üòÅ. So I decided to split things
into two pages. The [**Course Resources**](Course_Resources.qmd) page
lists materials directly related to and used/mentioned in the course.
This page lists a lot of other resources that are not heavily featured
in the course, but that might be useful and interesting. Everything
listed here is broadly related to the course topic, i.e. the resources
focus on Data Science/Stats/R Coding/GitHub/etc. For even more
materials, see the links to various lists by others at the end of this
document.

Most materials described below are (should be) freely available online.
For better or for worse, a lot of the resources I list below are dynamic
and ever changing. That means occasionally links might not work, sites
go offline, chapters in online books get re-arranged, etc. If any link
does not work and you can't access the materials for some reason, let me
know so I can update this document.

I placed them into categories according to main topic, but there is a
lot of overlap. Many R coding resources focus on data analysis, and most
data science resources I list focus on R.

I am familiar with some, but not all of these resources. Sometimes I
just took a quick glimpse to decide if it was worth including them here.
If you find particular resources especially helpful or unhelpful (both
listed and not listed), I'd love to receive feedback.

# General Data Science

-   [Cloud Based Data
    Science](https://leanpub.com/universities/set/jhu/chromebook-data-science) -
    a nice online course covering many of the topics we cover at a
    somewhat more basic level. You can decide what to pay for it,
    including getting it for free. That course used to be called
    [Chromebook Data
    Science](https://jhudatascience.org/chromebookdatascience/index.html)
    and seems to be now updated and rebranded as [Cloud Based Data
    Science](https://www.clouddatascience.org/). It is done by [Jeff
    Leek](http://jtleek.com/) and his team. You'll run into Jeff
    multiple times throughout this course.
-   ["Data Science Specialization" on
    Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1).
    One of the first comprehensive online offerings. Coursera has gotten
    more restrictive over the years, but I think you can still get each
    course for free.
-   [Stat 545](https://stat545.com/index.html) is the name of Jenny
    Bryan's previous course on Data Wrangling and exploratory analysis.
    She has since turned this into a stand-alone
    website/book/course/resource. Covers a bit similar topics to the
    R4DS book, but with a different emphasis and from a more
    comprehensive and advanced perspective.
-   [Advanced data analysis for the social
    sciences](http://www.princeton.edu/~mjs3/soc504_s2015/)
-   Advanced Data Science [version
    1](http://jtleek.com/advdatasci/index.html) and [version
    2](https://jhu-advdatasci.github.io/2018/index.html)
-   [Data science for economists](https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures)
-   [STOR 390 - Introduction to data
    science](https://idc9.github.io/stor390/)
-   [Kaggle (owned by Google)](https://www.kaggle.com/) is a website
    that hosts data analysis competitions. Everyone can participate and
    compete for - sometimes rather large - prizes. The website also has
    a lot of good datasets and code, as well as other resources related
    to data analysis. Definitely worth checking out.
-   I used to recommend and use Datacamp, an online platform that has
    interactive courses teaching R and Data Analysis (and other topics).
    Unfortunately, the company dealt rather poorly with a [case of
    sexual
    harassment](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/datacamp-sexual-harassment-metoo-tech-startup).
    They also became much less academic-friendly, their student discount
    is much less nice than it used to be, and apparently they recently
    sued R Studio (a company I think highly of). I'm not sure what the
    current status is on both their company culture and their
    academic/student-friendliness, but I have basically moved on. Too
    much other good stuff available to bother further.
-   [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://eda.seas.gwu.edu/) - materials
    for an online course teaching exploratory data analysis using R,
    taught by [John Paul Helveston](https://www.jhelvy.com/).
-   The journal PeerJ has a collection of articles on the topic of
    [Practical Data Science for
    Stats](https://peerj.com/collections/50-practicaldatascistats/). A
    lot of the papers in that collection use R.
-   Roger Peng and Hillary Parker have a Stats and Data Science related
    podcast called [Not so standard
    deviations](http://nssdeviations.com/).
-   A few individuals, most notably [Roger
    Peng](https://leanpub.com/u/rdpeng), [Brian
    Caffo](https://leanpub.com/u/bcaffo) and [Jeff
    Leek](https://leanpub.com/u/jtleek) have books on Leanpub related to
    R and data science. Most of the books have a minimum price of zero
    and are worth looking at. If you feel any of these Leanpub books are
    worth paying for, go ahead and do so. But I am fairly sure those
    authors do not rely on the book royalties for their living üòÑ, so if
    you can't or don't want to pay, getting them for free is ok. As a
    side note, Leanpub uses Markdown, which means if you write a report
    in (R)Markdown and want to turn it into a (self)-published book, it
    is rather easy to do with Leanpub. That's how those individuals made
    their books, as spin-offs from their RMarkdown course materials.
-   [*ModernDive - Statistical Inference via Data
    Science*](https://moderndive.com) - another good recent book
    covering data analysis with R.
-   [*Introduction to Modern
    Statistics*](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/) is a free online
    textbook teaching statistics using R in a modern framework.
-   [*Telling Stories with Data*](https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/) -
    an interesting way to discuss data analysis, focusing on the
    story/message.
-   [*Reproducible Medical Research with
    R*](https://bookdown.org/pdr_higgins/rmrwr/) - free online book
    showing how to use R to do basic analysis.
-   [*Data Science for the Biomedical
    Sciences*](https://ds4biomed.tech/) - another free online textbook.
    Part of a workshop, but can also be used for self-learning.
-   [*Elements of Statistical
    Learning*](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/) - is a somewhat
    advanced book on statistical/machine learning. Not useful as
    introduction, but a potentially good reference.
-   [*Interpretable Machine
    Learning*](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/) is
    an online book that discusses approaches that can be used to start
    making sense of sometimes complex ML models.
-   [Jesse Mostipak, aka Kiersi](https://www.twitch.tv/kierisi) streams
    data science sessions on Twitch.
-   [Nick Wan](https://www.twitch.tv/nickwan_datasci) is another date
    science Twitch streamer.
-   [David Robinson](https://www.youtube.com/user/safe4democracy/videos)
    has videos of screencasts showing him digging into datasets from
    TidyTuesday and other sources.
-   [Andrew Heiss](https://www.andrewheiss.com/) has a lot of good
    materials related to R and data analysis on his website.

# Data Sources and Wrangling

-   [`juicr` R
    package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/juicr/index.html)
    allows one to extract numerical values from figures.

# Data Visualization

-   [Data Visualization](https://datavizs21.classes.andrewheiss.com/) -
    comprehensive materials for an online course on data visualization
    in R, taught by [Andrew Heiss](https://www.andrewheiss.com/).
-   A great free book which discusses the principles of good data
    visualization is [*Fundamentals of Data
    Visualization*](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/). The book is not
    R specific (and doesn't show R code, but all figures are made in R).
    \* [*Data Visualization - A practical
    introduction*](https://socviz.co/) is a fairly complete free online
    draft of a book by the same name. It provides a general introduction
    to making good graphs, and the R code for the figures is shown.
-   [Flowing Data](https://flowingdata.com/) is a website with a lot of
    cool information on how to make great data visualizations. Some
    content is free, other parts are not.
-   The [`esquisse` R package](https://dreamrs.github.io/esquisse/) lets
    you quickly make ggplots in an interactive manner. Very good to get
    started on some exploratory plots. You can take the ggplot code you
    generated and tweak further.
-   [Graphics Principles](https://graphicsprinciples.github.io/) is a
    website that gives general tips for effective visual communication.
    Examples using R are also provided.
- [From Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/) is a website that guides you through selection of suitable visualizations based on your data. It also provides nice explanations of many useful plot types.
- [The R Graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/index.html) has a large collection of plots made with R, also showing the code. A great place for inspiration and copy/paste/modify.


# Pitfalls and best practices in data analysis {#sec-pitfalls}

## Researcher degrees of freedom (p-hacking)

-   The concept of [Researcher degrees of
    freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Researcher_degrees_of_freedom),
    which is related to [Data
    Dredging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging) and
    [*p-hacking*](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002106) are
    important ideas to keep in mind when doing a data analysis. Note
    that this issue is often cast in the language of p-values since
    those are still (unfortunately) the most common approach to
    statistical analyses. But the concept applies even if one doesn't
    use p-values.
-   You can find a fun hands-on exploration of the potential problem of
    researcher degrees of freedom in this [538
    visualization](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/p-hacking/) and
    another [choose-your-own adventure
    story](https://jabde.com/2022/03/20/p-hack-your-own-adventure/).
-   For further discussions of this general problem, see e.g. this
    [article from
    538](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-isnt-broken/)
    (which goes with the hands-on example just mentioned) or [Gelman's
    and Loken's
    article](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/the-statistical-crisis-in-science),
    with their closely related [article from
    2013](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/p_hacking.pdf).
-   [Simmons et al. 2011](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22006061/)
    provides a nice and easy to follow illustration how researcher
    degrees of freedom, combined with incomplete reporting, can lead to
    apparently nonsensical results. The study is a (fake) psychology
    study, but everything applies in general and it is easy to follow.
-   Not surprisingly, *xkcd* has also [covered the topic of
    p-hacking](https://xkcd.com/882/).

## Reproducible research

-   [Trisovic et al.
    2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01143-6) provides a
    nice glimpse at the problems that still exist when trying to
    reproduce/replicate prior studies by re-running the code.
-   [*R Workflow*](http://hbiostat.org/rflow/) is an online book
    describing how to do reproducible research using the R ecosystem and
    the still fairly new [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) framework.
-   For more Quarto, the [Awesome
    Quarto](https://github.com/mcanouil/awesome-quarto) repository has a
    nice curated list of links to resources.

# General Statistical Analysis

-   [Common statistical tests are linear
    models](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/) is a website
    that illustrates how many standard statistical tests are equivalent
    to certain types of linear models. Very useful if you are bewildered
    by the zoo of statistical tests and wonder how they are related to
    regression models.
-   [Library of Statistical Techniques](https://lost-stats.github.io/)
    is a collection of short explanations and code covering a range of
    different statistical topics. More general data analysis topics,
    e.g. wrangling and visualization, are also covered.
-   [Common statistical myths and how to push
    back](https://discourse.datamethods.org/t/reference-collection-to-push-back-against-common-statistical-myths/1787) -
    this is a collection of links to references that address/refute
    common statistical myths (i.e., things that are wrong but that are
    commonly done/said/written in the scientific literature anyway.)
-   [Improving Your Statistical
    Inferences](https://lakens.github.io/statistical_inferences/) is an
    online resource with useful information on how to improve various
    types of statistical analyses.
-   [Moving to a World Beyond
    "p\<0.05"](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2019.1583913)
    is a nice article with suggestions for how to report statistical
    results more appropriately than being fixated on p-values.

# Bayesian Analysis

*While we don't cover Bayesian methods in this course, I personally find
them very useful and compelling. Here are some resources that could be
worth checking out if you want to learn some Bayesian statistics/data
analysis.*

-   [*Statistical
    Rethinking*](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) by
    Richard McElreath. My favorite stats book (Bayesian or otherwise).
    It starts slow but goes pretty far. The book is not free (but worth
    the price), but there are resources on the website which are free.
-   [*Bayes Rules*](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/) by Johnson, Ott and
    Dogucu. Very hands-on introduction to Bayesian statistics. The
    online version is free.

<!-- # Longitudinal Analysis -->

```{=html}
<!-- * This [
set of lecture notes](https://data.princeton.edu/wws509/notes/c7s1) provide - among other topics - a nice introduction to survival modeling of longitudinal data. -->
```
# Causal Analysis

Unfortunately, as part of this course, we cannot cover the broad and
important topic of [causal
analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_analysis). However, it is
a topic worth learning. If you are interested, here are a few basic
references that can get you started. Most of the ones listed are fairly
non-technical and thus beginner-friendly.

-   [Short paper by Hern√°n
    2018](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2018.304337)
    provides a very basic and easy introduction and commentary on the
    topic of causal analysis.
-   [*Causal Inference - The
    Mixtape*](https://mixtape.scunning.com/index.html) is the free
    online version of a book that provides a good introduction to causal
    analysis/inference/modeling.
-   [*Causal Inference: What
    If*](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/)
    is a great book on the topic that's freely available online.
-   The above mentioned [*Statistical
    Rethinking*](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) by
    Richard McElreath also covers a good bit of causal analysis at a
    very accessible introductory level. He also has several great
    recordings on the topic on his [YouTube
    channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNJK6_DZvcMqNSzQdEkzvzA).
-   [Causal Inference in R
    Workshop](https://r-causal.github.io/causal_workshop_website/)
    contains workshop materials and a link to a book covering the topic.

# Machine Learning (ML)

-   [Machine Learning University (MLU)](https://mlu-explain.github.io/)
    is an educational offering from Amazon with several nice tutorials
    covering important ML-related topics. It also includes very basic
    statistical concepts such as linear/logistic regression.

# Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools

-   [Ethan Mollick's blog](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/) has a lot of
    generally useful information on AI use.

# R coding

-   [R Studio primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers) are a great
    collection of lessons covering the basics of R coding and data
    analysis. I highly recommend them.
-   [R Studio education](https://education.rstudio.com/) is a fairly new
    website that I expect will contain an increasing collection to all
    kinds of useful teaching resources related to R and Data Science.
    Check their *Learn* section for links to resources.
-   [`swirl`](http://swirlstats.com) is a package that teaches R
    inside R. Especially complete beginner students have found it to be
    a nice start since it provides very encouraging feedback. The
    downside is that all code writing happens interactively in the `R`
    console, which is not the way one writes real code. It's still worth
    checking out if you want to get some more direct, hands-on R
    practice. Unfortunately, the package seems dormant and hasn't been
    updated in a few years (but what's in there probably still works?)
-   [Ready for R](https://ready4r.netlify.app/) - materials for a basic
    introductory online R course taught by [Ted
    Laderas](https://laderast.github.io/).
-   [*Modern R with the tidyverse*](https://modern-rstats.eu/) - online
    book that provides a very nice introduction to important concepts of
    R coding with a focus on data analysis.
-   [Intro to Programming for Analytics](http://p4a.seas.gwu.edu/) -
    materials for an online course teaching intro to programming with R,
    taught by [John Paul Helveston](https://www.jhelvy.com/).
-   [*Efficient R
    programming*](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/) contains a
    lot of good tips and tricks towards writing better code.
-   [*R for Epidemiology*](https://www.r4epi.com/) - an introduction to
    R with a focus on tasks that are often used in Epidemiology/Public
    Health.
-   [*Tidy Modeling with R*](https://www.tmwr.org/) are the beginnings
    of a hopefully great and comprehensive book that describes
    analysis/modeling using the `tidyverse` set of packages.
-   [*Learning statistics with
    R*](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/) - I've not read/used it,
    but heard from others who like it.
-   [*What They Forgot to Teach You About R*](https://rstats.wtf/) is
    the beginning of an online book which covers some topics rarely
    found elsewhere. As of this writing, the book is fairly incomplete,
    but still worth checking out. Especially the first several chapters
    and the *debugging R code* sections are worth learning/reading.
-   [*The `Introverse` R
    package*](https://spielmanlab.github.io/introverse/index.html) is
    providing more novice-friendly help files for important `tidyverse`
    functions. If you struggle with the default help file for a
    function, check out this package.

# Git/GitHub

-   The [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) has a
    great introductory course that walks you through the basics of Git
    (and GitHub) step-by-step. This is useful if you want to know what
    exactly is going on, even if you mainly use a graphical interface
    for your Git/GitHub work. The whole course materials are
    [online](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/).

# Quarto

-   The [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/) has a ton of great
    information and documentation.
-   Here is another example and template of setting up a website with
    [Quarto](https://www.marvinschmitt.com/blog/website-tutorial-quarto/),
    similar to what you are asked to do for the [Introductory
    Exercise](../modules/module_intro_tools/Assessment_Course_Tools_Introduction.qmd).
-   [Quarto Club](https://quarto.club/) is a collection of nice Quarto
    website examples. Most of them have their source code on GitHub, so
    you can see how the creators of those pages accomplished what they
    made, and shamelessly copy/paste/adapt üòÅ.

# Lists and other sources

-   [Big Book of R](https://www.bigbookofr.com/) - a website listing and
    summarizing several hundred books, many free, related to R and Data
    Science. If you are looking for a resource on a specific topic, this
    is a good place to check.
-   By now, there are hundreds of books on R and Data Science available
    online. Many of these books are written in bookdown, a version of R
    Markdown. You will learn all about it in this course. It is worth
    checking out the [main bookdown website](https://bookdown.org/) as
    well as the [archive list](https://bookdown.org/home/archive/) and
    scrolling through the list of books. Some of the books you can find
    there are very good. Of course, there is also a good bit of "noise".
-   Another recent list of good R and Data Science resources is [Chris
    Engelhardt's GitHub
    repository](https://github.com/Chris-Engelhardt/data_sci_guide).
-   [Teach Data Science](https://teachdatascience.com/) - a blog with
    short, informative posts on various aspects related to data science
    using R.
-   [Machine
    Learning](https://m-clark.github.io/introduction-to-machine-learning/) -
    an online reference (almost book) which nicely explains some of the
    basics of machine learning.
-   RStudio has a [collection of materials for data
    science](https://resources.rstudio.com/the-essentials-of-data-science).
-   [R Studio
    cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) are 1
    page reference documents that quickly let you see how you use
    specific R packages or do certain tasks. A very useful resource,
    definitely check them out.
-   [A
    meta-cheatsheet](https://github.com/business-science/cheatsheets/blob/master/Data_Science_With_R_Workflow.pdf) -
    this is a cheat-sheet showing you links to different R packages and
    their cheat-sheets for specific tasks. A nice overview document,
    developed by the folks at
    [business-science.io](https://www.business-science.io/).
-   [Data Science Learning
    Resources](https://www.mbastack.org/data-science-learning-resources/) -
    a collection of links to resources that discuss general aspects of
    the data science field.
-   I created lists related to R and Data Analysis (as well as other
    topics). You can find all resource lists on [my
    website](https://andreashandel.github.io/research-and-teaching-resources/).
    (These lists are works in progress, and some are better/more useful
    than others. Feel free to send me links/resources to include).

# Overview

This documents provides more detailed instructions and grading rubrics for each part of the project.


# Part 1

**The main objective for part 1 is to describe data and qestion in enough detail that I can assess if the planned project is feasible.** 

To that end, provide the following pieces of information:

* Briefly describe what the data is, how it was collected, where you will get (or got) it from. How many observations do you have, what was measured? Anything else important to report about the data?
* At this stage you are not required to already have and show the data, but if you do, even better. Then add a few lines of code which load the data and using some of the commands you learned about, provide summmary descriptions of the data. 
* Explain the question you want to answer using the data. What will be your outcome(s) of interest (if any)? What (if any) specific predictors will you focus on? What relations/patterns are you looking for in the data?
* As much as you know, suggest how you will analyze it. At this stage in the course, we haven't covered analysis approaches yet, so you can keep things vague and non-technical here.
* You are allowed, but not yet required, to provide background information for the question you plan to answer. For instance you can describe why it's an interesting question, who else has done similar analyses, how your analysis will be new/different, etc. Similar to what you read in an introduction to a research paper. For the final report, you'll need these parts. For part 1, they are not required, but you are welcome to already scribble down some of that.
* Eventually, for your final report, what you write for this part will go into different sections of the full report. Some will go into the introdcution, some in the methods section. You can already place these items there, or for now just write them as a single section.

Grading for this part will follow the following rubric: 

| **Category** | **Description**  | **Score** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Absent | Everything or majority of submission is missing | 0 |
| Not sufficient | Submission is very incomplete, has major missing parts which does not allow assessment of feasiblity of proposed project | 50 |
| Sufficient | Submission is complete or fairly complete, contains enough information to allow assessment of feasibility of proposed project | 100 |


# Part 2

**The main objective for part 2 is to have mostly completed the data loading/cleaning/wrangling part, as well as having a mostly complete data exploration part.** 

To that end, provide the following pieces of information:

* Everything from part 1. That doesn't mean you need to keep what you wrote for part 1 frozen. Just that the description you provided there should be part of this submission. As appropriate, you can rewrite/reformat things to get it closer to a final report structure (e.g. start moving some parts into a method section).
* A somewhat detailed description containing text and code showing your cleaning/wrangling steps. You can have that in the main report. However, if you plan to write your project report like a manuscript, you might want to have a separate supplementary file which contains these details. 
* The main text should show plots or tables that explore the data, with a focus on the quantities of main interest (outcome, main predictor, co-variates of specific interest, etc.).
* It is up to you how you structure things. The combination of R or Rmd scripts and if you add comments into the code or use the text+code approach of Rmd files is your choice. Look for instance at Brian's project for ideas.
* Everything needs to be fully reproducible and you need to provide somewhere (e.g. in the main text file or in the readme file in your repository) instructions on what one needs to do to completely reproduce everything.
* Your main article and - if applicable supplementary files - should knit into a word or pdf or html document.
* I recommend that at this stage you start including references using the bibtex reference approach. The bib file should be provided too.

Grading for this part will follow the following rubric: 

| **Category** | **Description**  | **Score** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Absent | Everything or majority of submission is missing | 0 |
| Insufficient | Submission is very incomplete, major parts missing or not reproducible| 50 |
| Not fully sufficient | Submission is somewhat incomplete, minor parts missing or not reproducible| 75 |
| Sufficient | Submission is complete or fairly complete | 100 |



# Part 3

**The main objective for part 3 is to have started the analysis part of the project and continued to improve everything.** 

To that end, provide the following pieces of information:

* All relevant files and documents needed to reproduce everything.
* Some documentation (e.g. a readme.md file) explaining how your project is set up and which scripts need to be run in what order to reproduce everyting.
* A main article/manuscript file which contains the most pertinent findings. You should include more figures/tables here than you would in a regular manuscript. However, it should still be nicely readable, so don't produce page-long raw R output or similar things. Further figures and tables con go into supplementary document(s). The way you split content between main manuscript file and supplement is up to you.
* Files with code that are well documented, and that do all the previous tasks (cleaning/processing), as well as running a few analyses. You can start with simple bivariate ones, looking for patterns between your outcome(s) and individal predictors of interest. Those will likely take the form of scatterplots or boxplots or 2x2 tables, with accompanying statistical model analysis.

Grading for this part will follow this rubric: 

| **Category** | **Description**  | **Score** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Absent | Everything or majority of submission is missing | 0 |
| Insufficient | Submission is very incomplete, major parts missing or not reproducible| 50 |
| Not fully sufficient | Submission is somewhat incomplete, minor parts missing or not reproducible| 75 |
| Sufficient | Submission is complete or fairly complete | 100 |



# Part 4

**The main objective for part 4 is to have a fully completed project, ready for peer review.** 

To that end, provide the following pieces of information:

* Every file needed to reproduce your complete analysis and report in your project repository.
* Detailed instructions (e.g. as a `readme.md` file) explaining how to reproduce all your results.
* A complete, nicely readable and well formatted report, written in structure like a research paper (Abstract/Introduction/Methods/Results/Discussion/Citations).
* Well documented supplementary material/text, Rmd/R scripts, data, etc. as needed.
* bibtex file.
* Everything well documented.

I will not grade this part but it will be assessed by your peers, as described in the _Project Review_ document.



# Part 5

**The main objective for part 5 is to have a finished project, ready for final grading.** 

To that end, provide the following pieces of information:

* Everything from part 4, with improvements based on peer review feedback.

Grading for this part will follow the rubric provided in the _Project Review_ document.

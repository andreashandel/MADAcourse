<h1>Quiz</h1>
<p>Get the quiz sheet for this module from the general <a
href="./Course_Assessments.html"><strong>Assessments</strong></a> page.
Fill it in, then submit to the online grading system before the
deadline.</p>
</div>
<div id="exercise" class="section level1">
<h1>Exercise</h1>
<p>This project asks you to write code to do a simple data analysis.
This also involves group work, and of course GitHub.</p>
<p><strong>The first part of the project is due by Wednesday, so your
classmate can do their part before the Friday deadline.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Since this will be part of your portfolio site, and you
already posted a link to that previously, you don’t need to post
anything, I know where to find it. Therefore there is no exercise Slack
channel for this module.</strong></p>
<div id="group-setup" class="section level2">
<h2>Group setup</h2>
<p>Assign each member in your group an (arbitrary) number (I’m calling
them M1, M2, …). For this exercise, everyone will first work on their
own and finish this part by Wednesday. Then M1 will contribute to M2’s
repository, M2 will work on M3, etc. The last person (M3/M4/M5, based on
the number of people in our group), will work on M1’s repository. This
way, everyone will work on their own and one group member’s repository.
Details are given below.</p>
</div>
<div id="getting-started" class="section level2">
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>Open <strong>your portfolio website project</strong> in RStudio. Then
open the file for the coding exercise,
<code>coding_exercise.qmd</code>.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>Documenting well is very important! Add lots of comments to your
code/file. I suggest that your code should be more than half comments.
For every block of code, you have a few lines of comments at the
beginning explaining what the code block does, and then each line of
code gets its separate line of comment with more details. Comment on
both the how and why of your code. This much commentary might seem
overkill initially. But as your code gets more complex, it will be very
useful. Both your collaborators, and your future self looking at the
code you wrote several weeks ago will be incredibly thankful for your
comments!</p>
<p>If you write R code, your comments will be lines that start with
<code>#</code>. For QUarto or R Markdown files, you can either add
comments as Markdown text above/below your code, and/or add comments
inside your R code chunks. Both is ideal. R Studio allows you to quickly
turn sections of a document into comments or un-comment them (In the
<code>Code</code> section of the R Studio menu). That can be useful for
turning on/off code during testing, or hiding some parts of text that’s
just meant for you but not for the reader.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="loading-and-checking-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Loading and checking data</h2>
<p>We’ll look at and play with some data from the <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dslabs/index.html"><code>dslabs</code>
package</a>. Write a code chunk using the <code>library()</code>
function that loads the package (install the <code>dslabs</code> package
first if you don’t have it yet).</p>
<div class="note">
<p>It is good practice to load all packages at the beginning of your
code. So if you are using some R package, instead of loading it with
<code>library</code> just before you use it, place all your
<code>library</code> commands at the beginning of your R script or
Quarto file. Also, add a short comment explaining why you are loading a
certain package. For a complex project, it might even make sense to list
all packages you use in a <code>readme</code> file. Even better is to
use something like the <a
href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/"><code>renv</code> package</a>
which keeps track of all your packages and makes sure someone running
your project at a later time gets exactly the same packages you use.
While I’m not requiring <code>renv</code> for the course, I encourage
you to check it out and if you are up for it, use it for the class
exercises and the project.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>All the code you write for this (and any other) project
should be written into an R or Quarto file, not in the R console. The
reason for that is that you want a permanent record of what you did, and
the ability to modify and re-run your analysis easily.</strong> For this
exercise, you can either write the code directly into the Quarto
document, or if you prefer the setup of a separate R script and pulling
code into the Quarto document (see the data analysis template for an
example), you can do it that way too.</p>
<p>We’ll look at the <code>gapminder</code> dataset from
<code>dslabs</code>. Write a code chunk using the <code>help()</code>
function that pulls up the help page for the data to see what it
contains. Then use the <code>str()</code> and <code>summary()</code>
functions to take a look at the data. Use the <code>class()</code>
function to check what type of object <code>gapminder</code> is.</p>
<p>To illustrate how that should look, you should have these lines of
code so far for this exercise.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#load dslabs package
library(&quot;dslabs&quot;)
#look at help file for gapminder data
help(gapminder)
#get an overview of data structure
str(gapminder)
#get a summary of data
summary(gapminder)
#determine the type of object gapminder is
class(gapminder)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="processing-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Processing data</h2>
<div class="note">
<p>You can accomplish the next steps (and pretty much anything) with
just basic R commands and not using extra functionality from packages.
However, things are often easier with packages. For data processing
tasks, the packages from <a href="">the tidyverse</a> are very useful.
You can do the following tasks with any commands/packages you like.</p>
</div>
<p>Write code that assigns only the African countries to a new
object/variable called <code>africadata</code>. Run <code>str</code> and
<code>summary</code> on the new object you created. You should now have
2907 observations, down from 10545. Depending on how you do this, you
might also notice that all the different categories are still kept in
the <code>continent</code> (and other) variables, but show 0. R does not
automatically remove categories of what in R is called a factor variable
(a categorical variable) even if they are empty. We don’t have to worry
about that just now, but something to keep in mind, it can sometimes
lead to strange behavior.</p>
<p>Take the <code>africadata</code> object and create two new objects
(name them whatever you want), one that contains only
<code>infant_mortality</code> and <code>life_expectancy</code> and one
that contains only <code>population</code> and
<code>life_expectancy</code>. You should have two new objects/variables
with 2907 rows and two columns. Use the <code>str</code>, and
<code>summary</code> commands to take a look at both.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>I find it the least confusing to call <em>things which store values
in R</em> <code>objects</code> (e.g., <code>x</code> is an object here:
<code>x &lt;- 2 + 2</code>) and reserve the word <code>variable</code>
for a data variable, i.e., usually a column. However, it is common in
programming to refer to an <code>object</code> as a
<code>variable</code> as well. Because of that, I sometimes use that
terminology (inadvertently) too. So if I talk about a variable, you need
to determine from the context if I mean a certain variable in the data
(e.g. height or weight), or a variable in R (e.g. <code>x</code> or
<code>result</code>) that stores some content.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="plotting" class="section level2">
<h2>Plotting</h2>
<p>Using the new variables you created, plot life expectancy as a
function of infant mortality and as a function of population size. Make
two separate plots. Plot the data as points. For the plot with
population size on the x-axis, set the x-axis to a log scale.</p>
<p>You should see a negative correlation between infant mortality and
life expectancy, which makes sense. You should also see a positive
correlation between population size and life expectancy. In both plots,
especially the second one, you will see ‘streaks’ of data that seem to
go together. Can you figure out what is going on here? Take another look
at the <code>africadata</code> data we generated, which should give you
a hint of what’s happening.</p>
</div>
<div id="more-data-processing" class="section level2">
<h2>More data processing</h2>
<p>I’m sure you realized that the pattern we see in the data is due to
the fact that we have different years for individual countries, and that
over time these countries increase in population size and also life
expectancy. Let’s pick only one year and see what patterns we find. We
want a year for which we have the most data. You might have noticed that
in <code>africadata</code>, there are 226 NA (i.e., missing values) for
infant mortality. Write code that figures out which years have missing
data for infant mortality. You should find that there is missing up to
1981 and then again for 2016. So we’ll avoid those years and go with
2000 instead. Create a new object by extracting only the data for the
year 2000 from the <code>africadata</code> object. You should end up
with 51 observations and 9 variables. Check it with <code>str</code> and
<code>summary</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="more-plotting" class="section level2">
<h2>More plotting</h2>
<p>Let’s make the same plots as above again, this time only for the year
2000. Based on those plots, there seems to still be a negative
correlation between infant mortality and life expectancy, and no
noticeable correlation between population size and life expectancy.
Let’s apply some statistics to this data.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-simple-fit" class="section level2">
<h2>A simple fit</h2>
<p>Use the <code>lm</code> function and fit life expectancy as the
outcome, and infant mortality as the predictor. Then use the population
size as the predictor. (Use the data from 2000 only.) Save the result
from the two fits into two objects (e.g. <code>fit1</code> and
<code>fit2</code>) and apply the <code>summary</code> command to both,
which will print various fit results to the screen. Based on the
p-values for each fit, what do you conclude?</p>
</div>
<div id="sending-updates-to-github" class="section level2">
<h2>Sending updates to Github</h2>
<p>Once you are done with your exercise, re-build your website. Make
sure no error messages show up. A preview should show up, check that the
page for this exercise looks the way you want it to. Once you are happy
with how everything looks, close RStudio. Go to GitKraken, commit your
changes, and push to the remote repository. Check your portfolio website
online to make sure you can now see the newly created R exercise
document (in addition to your previously created <code>About</code>
page). Of course, at any point, feel free to make further enhancements
to your portfolio website.</p>
</div>
<div id="improving-each-others-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Improving each other’s work</h2>
<p>Once everyone has done their part (by <strong>Wednesday</strong> at
the latest), you’ll contribute to another group member’s project.</p>
<p>Earlier, we did collaborative work by having individuals added as
collaborators for a repository. There are other ways, we’ll try a
different one here, called the <strong>Fork and pull-request</strong>
workflow. You’ll be using that multiple times throughout this class.</p>
<p>The basic idea is as follows. First, you make a copy of someone’s
GitHub repository. In GitHub terminology, that is called doing a
<em>fork</em> of their repository. You can do that for any public
repository, even if you are not a collaborator on the repository.</p>
<p>Then you implement your improvements in the forked repository. Once
you are done, you ask the owner of the original repository to
incorporate the updates you made in the fork into their main repository.
This last part is called issuing a <strong>pull request</strong>. You
are requesting that the other person <em>pull</em> your changes into
their repository, hence the at times confusing (at least for me)
terminology. I prefer to think of them as <em>merge</em> requests or
<em>sync</em> requests, i.e. you are requesting that they merge or sync
your changes into their repository. You’ll find the terminology
<em>merge request</em> is used at times. If the person who controls the
main repository likes your changes, they will <em>merge</em> your fork
into the main branch. And just like that, you have contributed to some
project becoming better! We will practice this <em>fork and pull</em>
flow now.</p>
<p>Find the repository of the team member you will contribute to and
<code>Fork</code> their repository. <strong>You can’t find links to
everyone’s portfolio repository in the <code>Introductions</code> Slack
channel.</strong> Then clone it to your local machine, as you have done
previously with your own repositories. In fact, this fork is now your
own repository, you have it forever, even if the person who owns the
original repository deletes theirs.</p>
<p>Open the file that contains the coding exercise. It should look
fairly similar to yours, though probably somewhat different since there
are many ways to do things in R, and their comments might be
different.</p>
<p>Start a new section below the part your classmate did. <strong>Add a
sentence to indicate where your section starts and also add your
name.</strong> E.g., you can write something like “this section added by
YOURNAME”.</p>
<p>Write some more code to do some more analysis of the dataset. This is
fairly open-ended. I want you to create a few more plots of the data,
and fit another model to some parts of data and display the fitting
results in a table. You can e.g. use the <code>broom</code> package to
convert output from <code>lm</code> into a data frame you can show as a
table. What exactly you explore, plot and fit is up to you.</p>
<p>Once you wrote your code, confirm that it runs without problems and
errors, and produces the expected results. Once everything is good,
commit and push your changes to the remote. Note that this pushes to
<strong>your fork</strong> (i.e. copy) of the repository. Now it’s time
to offer your contribution to your classmate to integrate into their
repository.</p>
</div>
<div id="making-a-pull-request" class="section level2">
<h2>Making a pull request</h2>
<p>Let’s contribute your code to your classmate’s project. Go to the
GitHub.com website for your (forked) repository. In the top left, you
should see the <em>New Pull Request</em> button. (Underneath, it should
say something like <code>this branch is N commits ahead of NNN</code>).
Click the <em>New Pull Request</em> button. A page comes up showing what
you want to do, which is to send your changes to the original
repository. You are requesting that the other person <em>pull</em> your
changes into their repository. Hopefully, you’ll see a green check-mark
that says <em>able to merge</em>. If your classmate made changes to the
same files you did, it could have created a merge conflict. Hopefully,
this won’t be the case. In either case (merge conflict or not), you can
click the green button and <em>Create a pull request</em>. You are
presented with a box in which you want to add a meaningful title, so the
other person knows what you changed and some more explanation in the
box. Then click <em>Create pull request</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="checking-and-merging-pull-requests" class="section level2">
<h2>Checking and merging pull requests</h2>
<p>Once your classmate who has worked on your repository creates a pull
request, you should receive a notification that a pull request was
created. Go to the GitHub site and to your online portfolio repository.
Click on <em>Pull requests</em>, then click on the request (there should
only be one). Take a look. On the first page, it shows you their message
and if there are conflicts with your version of the repository.
Hopefully, you didn’t change things around while they did, so there
shouldn’t be any conflicts. Click on the <em>Files changed</em> button,
which will show you an overview of the code they changed. Removals are
red, and additions are green.</p>
<p>On the main pull request site, you can do various things. If you
don’t like the suggested edits, you can write a comment and close the
pull request without merging their changes into your repository. If you
like most of what they did, but there is something they need to adjust,
write a comment and let them know. Still, close the pull request and ask
them to send a new one. If you are ok with their changes (hopefully,
this is the case here), you can merge the pull request and close it.
Their updates are now part of your repository.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> To check that everything is ok, pull the
updated repository to your local computer. Rebuild the website, make
sure the preview looks ok and all the updates show. Since the website
rebuilt on your local machine likely changed some files, commit your
updates, push to the remote. If you now go to your portfolio website,
you should see the changes from your classmates showing underneath what
you wrote originally.</p>
<p><strong>Since this will be part of your portfolio site, and you
already posted a link to that previously, you don’t need to post
anything, I know where to find it.</strong></p>
<div class="note">
<p>I mentioned this before, but it doesn’t hurt repeating. At times, you
will get merge conflicts. At that stage, it gets a bit tricky. GitKraken
has a good tool to help you resolve conflicts, and it works well for
text files (code, Rmd, md, etc.). It doesn’t work well for other files
(word, Excel, etc.). Sometimes you have to temporarily move one of the
conflicting files out of the repository, then do the merge, then
manually see how the files changed and do the merge yourself. To
minimize conflicts, it is good practice to make multiple pull requests
with small changes instead of a single large pull request. If you
changed 20 files and 2 of them create a conflict, the person has to
reject your complete pull request if they don’t want those conflicts. It
is better to change a few files and work on just one topic, then issue a
pull request. After that, start the next set, and issue another pull
request. By breaking them up, it is more likely that conflicts are
avoided or localized.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="more-information" class="section level2">
<h2>More information</h2>
<p>Some more information on <em>forks</em> and <em>pulls</em> and what
to do if things don’t go right can be found in <a
href="https://happygitwithr.com/">happygitwithR</a>. Note that a lot of
the commands described for use on the command line
(e.g. <code>stash</code>) can be applied graphically through
GitKraken.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>Github also has <em>branches</em>. Those are similar to forks but
meant for more internal use. For instance, if you have a project and
want to implement something new, but it might not work, you can create a
branch, work in that branch, and once everything is ok, you can merge
the branch into the main/master. This is useful if you write software
that others are using, and you don’t want to break the whole thing. It
is also helpful if you work with collaborators on a project. To be able
to use branches, you need to be an owner or member of a repository. In
contrast, you can fork any public repository.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="another-fork-and-pull-exercise" class="section level2">
<h2>Another <em>fork and pull</em> exercise</h2>
<p><strong>This is optional. You can do it at any time during this
course (and more than once) 😁.</strong></p>
<p>Help improve the course with your contributions! Find something
wrong/unclear/worth improving with this course (e.g. a typo, something
confusing, a broken link, a suggestion for a new reference, or anything
else). Go to the <a
href="https://github.com/andreashandel/MADAcourse">Github repository for
this course</a>. Follow the steps outlined above: Fork the course to
your personal account, clone it to your local computer, implement your
updates, push it back to GitHub, then initiate a pull request. I will
get a notification of your pull request. If things look ok and no
conflicts exist, I will merge your improvements into the course. And
just like that, you have contributed to improving this course! (And of
course, you will be listed in the <em>Acknowledgments</em> section of
the main course page.)</p>

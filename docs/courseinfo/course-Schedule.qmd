## Synchronous Zoom meetings

I will offer a weekly Zoom meeting (aka office hour). See the [**Communication**](course-communication.qmd) section for some more details. As described in the **Communication** document, if you don't join the Zoom meetings you are not missing any important information, these are just **completely optional** opportunities to ask for help/feedback etc.

You can find the Zoom link on Discord. The plan is to have weekly alternating times for those zoom meetings such that everyone is able to make the meeting at least every 2 weeks.

The current plan is to have **Zoom meetings for odd module numbers on Wednesdays at 8am, and for even module numbers on Tuesdays at 8am. The first Zoom session will be on Wednesday, 1/10 at 8am ET.**

Hopefully, at least one of those two times works for you, allowing you to join at least every other time if wanted. If you already know that neither times work for you, and you are keen on joining the Zoom meetings, let me know and we can adjust.

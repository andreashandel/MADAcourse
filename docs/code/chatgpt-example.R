# Code generated by ChatGPT 3.5 on 2023-10-30 based on this prompt:

#Write R code that generates a dataset of 100 individuals with ages from 18 to 49, BMI values from 15 to 40 and smoking status as yes or no. Assume that age and BMI are uncorrelated. Assume that smokers have a somewhat lower BMI. Then use the patchwork R package to generate a panel of ggplot2 plots. The first panel should show a violin plot with BMI on the y-axis and smoking status on the x-axis. The second panel should show a scatterplot with age on the y-axis and BMI on the x-axis. Add thorough documentation to your code.

# Create a violin plot

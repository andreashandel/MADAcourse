**If you are new to R/coding, this module could take a good amount of time. I estimate >20 hours to work through things properly. So budget your time accordingly and plan ahead!** 

# Overview
In this module, we will (re)-visit some of the basics of R (and RStudio). This is likely the one unit which will have the greatest diversity in pre-existing knowledge. Some of you might already have enough R knowledge that this will just be a quick refresher. For those among you who have not used R before, this unit (and everything else related to R in this course) will take a lot of time. Be prepared to put in a good bit of time and effort. If you do, I'm fairly certain you find it worth it. If you don't, you'll likely not get much out of the course.


# Learning Objectives
* Basic knowledge working with R and RStudio 
* Starting knowledge of R coding
* Be familiar with the `tidyverse`
* Be familiar with resources that help you learn R 

# Learning to code
R (or any other programming language) is best learned by "doing it". You will learn more R as we go along, but the focus of the class is on data analysis, so while I will provide you with resources to figure out the R bits, outside of this module we will not be focusing on 'learning R'. You will learn by doing as we go through the course. As with anything, the more you practice, the better you will get. You should approach learning to code with an attitude of _fearless curiosity_. You will get stuck, you will get frustrated with some weird error message in your code (still happens to me at least once a week), and you will eventually figure it out. Make use of the great resources that are out there. They are all listed below and in the _Resources_ section.

This figure is [from a good article](https://www.thinkful.com/blog/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard/) discussing the journey of learning to write code:

[Read the article](https://www.thinkful.com/blog/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard/) from which this figure comes. Or read at least the first part and look at the first two figures. 

My goal is that during this course, you will reach the beginning of the _upswing of awesome_, at least when it comes to being able to use R to perform data analyses. But to get there, you'll have to go over the _cliff of confusion_ and through the _desert of despair_, and I'm confident that you'll get there and won't be stuck in the _hand-holding honeymoon_. In fact, at times I'm providing you less detailed instructions than I could to get you quickly to the stage where you have to figure out bits yourself. I guess one could say that instead of hand-holding, I let you stumble and fall some, and then will help you to get back up `r emo::ji('smiley')`. It might feel a bit more frustrating at least initially, but it's a much better way to learn.

And of course, it goes without saying that this is not a linear process. Even after many years of coding and using R, I regularly encounter the _cliff of confusion_ and the _desert of despair_ if I'm trying to do something new I haven't done before and invariably get stuck.


# Learning the basics of R

Going through the resources below and practicing the material will likely take a good bit of time for those new to programming. I estimate 20+ hours! You will also likely have to come back and revisit R coding throughout the course. Be prepared to spend a good bit of time learning some coding. I think it's a skill that's worth the effort `r emo::ji('smiley')`.

*Note: If you already know a god bit of R, most of these exercises will be refreshers. Go through them anyway, since I will ask some quiz questions about them.*


RStudio is starting to develop [a nice set of online tutorials they call Primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers). We'll be doing several of those in this class. For now, we'll start with the one called [programming basics](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1.2). Work through this tutorial. Note that some of the bits surrounding the exercises are somewhat strange. You can generally type anything you want into the R boxes, and you always get a 'that's right' kind of message. The R package that is used to write this tutorial is in the early stages of development and is not full-featured yet. I'm sure it will get better over time. The whole tutorial should still work.

_Note: There are two ways of assigning something to an object in R, one can write `x <- 2` or `x = 2` and almost always that is the same. People argue about which way to do it. In the RStudio tutorial, they do it the first way. If you are completely new to programming, I recommend the first version, i.e. `x <- 2`. The problem is that most other programming languages do it the second way, so if you learned to code in another language first (like I did), it's more natural to write `x = 2`. It's your choice. Just be aware that both notations exist and do the same thing. When I write code, I do a mix (without any logic to it)._

__As you work through the primer programming tutorial, write down the solutions to the questions. Some will show up on the quiz.__

Once you've gone through the RStudio tutorial, read and work through [chapter 3 of IDS](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/r-basics.html). There will be some overlap between the RStudio tutorial and this chapter. That's ok. Repetition doesn't hurt. The IDS chapter goes beyond the RStudio tutorial. Try to code along, by entering the code you see in the book into your R console. Also, do the exercises at the end of some of the sections. **This will likely take a good bit of time.**

__As you do the exercises in IDS chapter 3, write down the solutions. Or write down the code in an R script so you can quickly access and re-run things. I will ask for some of the answers on the quiz.__



# More R coding 

We only cover R coding in a single module. That is obviously not enough to become proficient at it. For the rest of the course, I expect you to learn _on the side_ the coding bits you need to get things done. I understand this will be a challenge. Don't hesistate to seek help.

I strongly recommend that you read and work through [chapter 4 of IDS](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/programming-basics.html) (including doing the exercises) and go through the [RStudio _Functions_ tutorial](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/6). Those two sources cover some overlapping material with important topics for R (and really, any programming language), such as functions, flow control and branching. Try to read and work through the materials and understand as much as possible. If you are new to coding, it is likely you won't fully understand everything on the first read. That's ok. The important part is that you hear about these concepts and are aware of them. Once you start to need them for your analysis (and for any serious analysis, you will), you can then revisit the topics and dig in more deeply to get to the level where you can understand and apply them to your problems.

__I will not ask any quiz questions on this material, and it is ok if you don't manage to go through this material before the module deadline. But make sure you go through it soon. I assume going forward that you will have worked your way through it and will know what is covered.__


# Getting help
Maybe the most important skill for learning any programming language is figuring out how to find and get help with any problem. Google, Stackoverflow, and the Internet are your friend. If you have a problem with your code, it's likely someone else had the same/similar problem before you and asked a question (and probably got an answer). So search the web, you'll find something useful most of the time.

```{r versioncontrol,  echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Fortunately rare for R. Source: xkcd.com.', out.width = '60%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./media/xkcd_wisdom_of_the_ancients.png")
```

In those rare cases when you cannot find information online that helps you figure out your problem, feel free to ask for help. The _Resources_ document describes various ways to get help. 

A great source for answers is asking questions online. Sometimes, people complain that replies to questions they ask online are unfriendly or harsh. While this is at times true, consider that all the people providing answers are volunteers. They're doing it because they want to help others, they don't get paid for it. It is therefore important that the person asking the question does not waste people's time by asking poorly formulated questions or questions that have been previously answered. In general, those kinds of questions get rude replies. If you have done your homework (i.e., searched online first to see if the answer is already available) and can precisely formulate the question/problem, ideally with a reproducible example, the chance that you get an unfriendly reply is very low. 

I have found that a good way of posing question is to write something like this: _"I need help with SPECIFIC PROBLEM, I have searched around and found LINKS/DESCRIPTION OF SIMILAR ISSUES but that doesn't quite solve my problem yet."_ If you have a coding problem, add _"Here is some code illustrating what I want to achieve and where the problem is."_ and then add a [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example). 

The more you show you've done your homework and are truly stuck (instead of just being lazy and wanting others to do the work for you), and the easier you make it for others to understand what your problem is, the more likely you will get good answers.

As you continue on your coding journey, keep in mind: **The great thing about programming is that you can't really "break" things too much. Worst case you get an error message. So experiment and try out anything you like!**

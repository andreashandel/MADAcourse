## Quiz

Get the quiz sheet for this module from the general [__Assessments__](./Course_Assessments.html) page. Fill it in, then submit to the online grading system before the deadline. 


## Exercise

For this module, you are asked to do a coding project. This also involves group work, and of course GitHub. 


# Overview

This project asks you to write a bit of code to do a simple data analysis. 
We'll be using the Github workflow so that we can practice it some more.
For now, we'll be using base R syntax. At some later point, we'll do analyses using different R packages from the tidyverse. 

** Even if you are already familiar with various R packages, I want you to do this exercise without their help. The only package you are allowed to load and use is the `dslabs` package to get the data.**


TODO - COLLECT R CODING LEVEL INFO ON GOOGLE FORMS


# Project setup
* Open your portfolio website project in RStudio. 


# R content creation

_It is best to call things which store values `objects` and use `variable` for a data variable, i.e., usually a column. However, it is common to refer to things that store values as a `variable` as well. Because of that, I sometimes use that terminology inadvertently too. So if I talk about a variable, you need to determine from the context if I mean a certain variable in the data, i.e., a predictor variable, or a variable in R that stores some content, i.e., an object._

_In the instructions below, I will mention each function you need to use. You can do all of the tasks with the functions I mention. You can use other __base R__ functions if you like, just no other packages._

## Getting started
* We'll use an R Notebook for this exercise. It is a type of R Markdown document. You can [learn more here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html). Choose _File_, _New File_, _R Notebook_. A new file shows up. Read through the provided information, then delete all but the YAML header. Give it a title like _YOURNAME Coding Exercise_. Now you are ready to write some R code!
* **Remember to put a lot of commentary into your code/file! As a rule of thumb, I suggest around half of what you write should be comments explaining what you do and why. This is very helpful, especially as you start learning to write code. And it makes it much easier for your future selves and others to follow.**

## Loading and checking data
* We'll look at and play with some data from the [`dslabs` package](https://simplystatistics.org/2018/01/22/the-dslabs-package-provides-datasets-for-teaching-data-science/). Write a code chunk using the `library()` function that loads the package (install the `dslabs` package first if you don't have it yet).
* We'll look at the `gapminder` dataset from `dslabs`. Write a code chunk using the `help()` function that pulls up the help page for the data to see what it contains. Then use the `str()` and `summary()` functions to take a look at the data. Use the `class()` function to check what type of object `gapminder` is.

## Processing data
* Using _base R notation_, assign only the African countries to a new object/variable called `africadata`. Run `str` and `summary` on the new object you created. You should now have 2907 observations, down from 10545. You might also notice that all the different factor categories are still kept in the `continent` (and other) variables, but show 0. R does not automatically remove levels of factors even if they are empty. We don't have to worry about that just now, but something to keep in mind, it can sometimes lead to strange behavior.
* Again using _base R notation_, take the `africadata` object and make two new variables (name them whatever you want), one that contains only `infant_mortality` and `life_expectancy` and one that contains only `population` and `life_expectancy`. The `c()` function might be useful to efficiently pull out the variables you want. You should have two new objects/variables with 2907 rows and two columns. Use the `str`, and `summary` commands to take a look at both variables.

## Plotting
* Using the new variables you created, plot life expectancy as a function of infant mortality and as a function of population size. Make two separate plots. Use base R plot commands, i.e., the `plot` function. Plot the data as points. For the plot with population size on the x-axis, set the x-axis to a log scale.

You should see a negative correlation between infant mortality and life expectancy, which makes sense. You should also see a positive correlation between population size and life expectancy. In both plots, especially the 2nd one, you will see 'streaks' of data that seem to go together. Can you figure out what is going on here? Take another look at the `africadata` data we generated, which should give you a hint of what's happening. 


## More data processing
* I'm sure you realized that the pattern we see in the data is due to the fact that we have different years for individual countries, and that over time these countries increase in population size and also life expectancy. Let's pick only one year and see what patterns we find. We want a year for which we have the most data. You might have noticed that in `africadata`, there are 226 NA (i.e., missing values) for infant mortality. Write some base R code that figures out which years have missing data for infant mortality. You should find that there is missing up to 1981 and then again for 2016. So we'll avoid those years and go with 2000 instead. The `is.na()` function might be helpful. You can use the `print()` function to print the missing years to the console.
* Let's create a new object by extracting only the data for the year 2000 from the `africadata` object. You should end up with 51 observations and 9 variables. Check it with `str` and `summary`.


## More plotting
* Let's use base R plotting again and do the same two plots again, this time only for the year 2000. We don't need to create those intermediate objects that only contained the variables we want to plot. We did that just for practice.

Based on those plots, there seems to still be a negative correlation between infant mortality and life expectancy, and no noticeable correlation between population size and life expectancy. Let's apply some statistics to this data.

## A simple fit
* Use the `lm` function and fit life expectancy as the outcome, and infant mortality as the predictor. Then use the population size as the predictor. Save the result from the two fits into two objects (e.g. `fit1` and `fit2`) and apply the `summary` command to both, which will print various fit results to the screen. Based on the p-values for each fit, what do you conclude? 


# Sending updates to Github
* Once you are done with your exercise, under the `Run` menu (top left) select `Restart R and Run all Chunks`. Make sure no error messages show up.
* Under `Preview` do `knit to html`. You can also try a different output (pdf or word). Those files should now be in your project directory. Once you are happy with things, close RStudio. 
* Go to GitKraken. You should see a notification about changed files. Click _view changes_, then _Stage_. Write a commit message, commit the changes, then _Push_ them. If things work, your local folder and the online repository should be at the same level. Your project is now online.



# Getting help
* Use any online sources you want. Also, feel free to push your project with the error message to Github, then post on the discussion board a description of your problem with a link to your file, so others can see what isn't working and can give you better help.



# Discussion

Describe one thing you learned in this module about R that you find rather annoying or confusing or dumb, and one thing about R that you find interesting or cool or awesome.

Then comment/reply to your classmates posts.

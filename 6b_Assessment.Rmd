# Module Assessments

Make sure you've gone through all the content for this module.

## Quiz

Do the quiz for this module on eLC. The quiz consists of around 5-10 fairly easy questions. It is timed, so you need to have gone through the material and either remember some of the main items or at least remember where you saw it so you can look it up quickly.


## Exercise

For this module, do the exercise called _Tidyverse_. In this exercise, you will repeat an analysis you previously did using base R, but now using the `Tidyverse` packages. You will also learn some more Github functionality and workflows.

# Overall project content evaluation
Evaluate overall features of the project  by filling in the sections below.


## Structure
Is the project well structured? Are files in well labeled folders? Do files have reasonable names? Are all "junk" files not needed for analysis/reproduction removed? By just looking at files and folders, can you get an idea of how things fit together?

### Feedback and Comments

WRITE YOUR FEEDBACK HERE

### Summary assessment
* poor and confusing structure
* mostly clear, but some confusing parts (e.g. useless files, things in the wrong folders)
* well structured


## Documentation 
How well is the project documented? Are you able to understand each step of the whole analysis, each decision that was made, and each line of code? Is enough information provided as comments in code or as part of Rmd files? 

### Feedback and Comments

WRITE YOUR FEEDBACK HERE

### Summary assessment
* poorly documented
* decently documented with some gaps
* fully and well documented



## Reproducibility
Are all results fully reproducible? Is documentation provided which clearly explains how to reproduce things, and does it work without the need for any manual intervention? Are you able to re-run the whole analysis without having to do manual interventions/edits?

### Feedback and Comments

WRITE YOUR FEEDBACK HERE


### Summary assessment
* major parts not reproducible 
* small parts not reproducible or required manual intervention 
* fully reproducible without issues


## Thoroughness
How thorough was the overall study? Were alternatives (e.g. different ways of processing the data or different models) considered? Were alternatives discussed? Were the questions/hypotheses fully and thoroughly addressed?

### Feedback and Comments

WRITE YOUR FEEDBACK HERE

### Summary assessment

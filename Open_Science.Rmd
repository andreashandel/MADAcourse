# Overview

In this unit, we'll talk a bit more about reproducible research, and how that fits into the much larger concept of "open science."



# Learning Objectives

* Understand the general idea of open science
* Explain what makes research reproducible and/or replicable
* Know what FAIR data standards are

# Introduction

Way back at [the beginning of the course](https://andreashandel.github.io/MADAcourse/Tools_Reproducibility.html),
we briefly discussed reproducibility. In this module, we'll learn a bit more about
what that means, and why you pretty much need to have a solid grasp on
reproducible research strategies in the future. We'll also talk about how
reproducibility fits into the more general framework of Open Science, and
proper treatment of data and code in this framework.

# White House open science requirements

I'm not going to bury the lead on this one, there is a very important reason
for you to care about reproducibility and open science. Several US government
organizations have said that [2023 is the Year of Open Science](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/news/year-of-open-science), and a recent
Office of Science and Technology Policy [memo](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/08/25/ostp-issues-guidance-to-make-federally-funded-research-freely-available-without-delay/) has recommended that all federal agencies take
some serious steps towards open science practices (more on what exactly
this "open science" thing is later).

Federal agencies like the NIH have been requiring data sharing and public
releases of papers (on PMC) for some time now, but these recommended measures
are even stronger, and in my opinion, a very positive direction for science.
It is quite likely that if you work with federal funding in the near future,
you will be required to share your data and code publicly as soon as you
decide to publish. The exact implementation of these protocols hasn't been
determined yet (nor has the degree to which these recommendations will be
formally implemented), but the writing is on the wall, so to speak.

**It is easier for you to get comfortable with reproducible research methods
and open science now, rather than scrambling to learn it in the future!**

# The general idea of open science

So if you google "what is open science," which I tried to do when I was first
learning this stuff, you'll get a confusing mess of microsoft SmartArt graphics
that are, in general, not too helpful. I think that [this paper](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-021-01304-y)
and [this paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020EA001562)
provide pretty good conceptual discussions of open science, but I think the
best of these SmartArt-type graphics is from [NASA](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/open-science/oss-for-eso-workshops).

```{r open science,  echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Open science is like spaghetti sauce--it has a lot of ingredients that have to be cooked together to get the best flavor.', out.width = '50%', fig.align='center',fig.alt="A circular graphic with 'open science' in the center, showing several components of open science around it."}
knitr::include_graphics("./media/open-science.jpg")
```

NASA defines three components that are central to open science.

1. Accessible -- your research process and results need to be transparent. Open access,
FAIR data, and code sharing all fall into this.
2. Reproducible -- other people should be able to get the same results as you,
and you should strive to make reusable products.
3. Inclusivity -- if your research is only accessible and reproducible for
relatively well-off scientists at major institutions in the USA, it's still
not really open `r emoji::emoji("slightly smiling face")`.

If you want a formal definition of "open science," here's the one from the
OSTP, which is pretty comprehensive:

> “The principle and practice of making research
products and processes available to all, while
respecting diverse cultures, maintaining security
and privacy, and fostering collaborations,
reproducibility, and equity.”

OK, let's go into just a bit more detail about each of these topics.

# Accessibility and fair data

Open access publishing is a big topic, but for the purposes of this class
I will just say that I think you should publish Open Access whenever possible.
While you're a student at UGA, [our library has a fund](https://www.libs.uga.edu/openaccessfund)
that can help you with this. In the future, it seems likely that any federally
funded projects in the US will require an open access fund as part of the budget,
as publishing OA can often be prohibitively expensive. If you want to learn
more I'll again direct you to the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access),
or if you *really* want to learn more, to [Peter Suber's book on OA](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/10752204/9780262517638_Open_Access.pdf).

The main purpose of this section is to talk about data sharing. Data sharing
used to be a pretty contentious topic, but fortunately it is more normalized
now than it has ever been before, and thanks to NIH (and other agency mandates),
it will likely be a normal part of science before too long.

Of course just dumping your nasty, messy data in a depository is not great
for accessibility and reproducibility. As some of you noticed during this
course, even data from the CDC or other reputable organizations is often
very poorly formatted and does not have a lot of metadata or documentation
to help you out. To somewhat solve this issue, we can look to the FAIR data
standards, which were originally published in [this 2016 publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618).
Another great resource is the [GO FAIR initative](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).
What I can say here is just a limited summary of these two papers, so I
highly recommend that you do those readings. But here's the short version.

For digital assets to be useful when you dump them online, they should be:

1. **F**indable: when someone goes to your paper or project, they should be
able to easily get to the data source.
2. **A**ccessible: users need to be able to access the data, and data are stored
in a way that users can feasibly get them.
3. **I**nteroperable: data should be in standardized formats, using standard
vocabulary. You should be specific if your data is derived from another dataset
or if the user will need other related datasets.
4. **R**eusable: data should be documented and version-controlled when you
release it, with clear descriptions of what information is contained in the
data, who can use the data, and for what purposes.

Of course dealing with things like data use agreements and individual privacy
is paramount, so 100% achieving these goals all the time is not feasible.
Sometimes you might need to use [synthetic data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_data)
based on your real data, remove certain information from your data to protect
privacy, or require a data use agreement before you can distribute the
data to individuals. We should strive for data to be as FAIR as possible,
but protecting individual privacy is equally important!

# Reproducibility (and replicability too)

Andreas' notes from before provide a pretty comprehensive definition of **reproducibility**,
so if you don't remember, review those. In one sentence, *your research is reproducible if
another scientist can repeat your methods on your data and get the same results.* That is, someone
else can take your code and data, rerun all your code, and get the same answers that you
got in your paper.

An important and related issue is **replicability** -— you've probably heard of
the "replication crisis" in science. If not, I'll refer you to the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis)
instead of any more specific sources. In one sentence, *your research is
replicable if someone else can follow your methods and materials to collect
new data, analyze their data, and get similar results*. Of course in
social and semi-social sciences (like epidemiology), when your results often
depend on the target population of interest and are expected to vary over
time, replicability can be a bit more nuanced than in an experimental
field, where experiments should pretty much control for anything that you
aren't interested in.

# Inclusivity

The topic of inclusivity in data science is heavily tied into the idea of
data ethics -- critical thinking about the potential results and consequences
of the products we create is crucial in data science. Many people taking
this class are epidemiologists, and will be familiar with [the Belmont Report](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html).
Regardless of your scientific background, when working with data (especially
human subjects data), the guiding principles of respect for persons, beneficience, and justice
should be critical considerations for all of our research.

There are authors who can explain the importance of
inclusivity and data science ethics much better than I can. I recommend the
following resources.

we haven't even scratched the surface of. If you want to go deeper or learn
more, here are a few places you can find more open science resources.

* The Center for Open Science, a nonprofit dedicated to promoting open science
practices and community change, maintains [a blog](https://www.cos.io/blog)
with several thought provoking readings.
* Statistician Andrew Gelman sometimes writes about open science, mostly from
a statistical perspective and has some nice comments on replication.

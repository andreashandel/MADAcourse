# Module Assessments

Make sure you've gone through all the content for this module.

## Quiz

Do the quiz for this module on eLC. The quiz consists of around 5-10 fairly easy questions. It is timed, so you need to have gone through the material and either remember some of the main items or at least remember where you saw it so you can look it up quickly.


## Exercise

For this module, do the exercise called _Visualization_. In this exercise, you will be asked to reproduce as closely as possible a "professional" graph.

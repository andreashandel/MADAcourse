# Modern Applied Data Analysis (MADA)

<!-- Date is added here instead of YAML heading so the logo floats at the top right of the page -->

<!-- Last modified: 2025-12-14 -->

Welcome to the **Modern Applied Data Analysis (MADA)** course website.

This website contains almost all the content of an online graduate level course taught by [Andreas Handel](https://www.andreashandel.com/) at the University of Georgia.
Most materials are hosted here, some are on external sites and either linked or embedded from here.

<!-- _**The course is currently not running. The website will likely receive none or only minor updates until the next time the course will be offered (tentatively spring 2026).**_ -->


**This course website is currently being updated for the upcoming semester. As long as this message is shown, consider the current website outdated.**

<!-- _**The course is currently running. The website will be updated throughout the semester. Things might change (though likely not by a whole lot). Visit/check regularly, especially the Schedule. Note the last update time above.**_ -->

# Website content

The [**General Information**](courseinfo/course-overview.qmd) section provides a class [**Syllabus**](courseinfo/course-syllabus.qmd) and a [**Schedule**](courseinfo/course-schedule.qmd).
The latter will likely be updated throughout the course, so check it regularly.
The [**Communication**](courseinfo/course-communication.qmd) page provides information on how course communications are planned to happen.

The majority of the content is listed under the [**Content**](content/content-overview.qmd) heading.
The content is split into modules.
Each module contains several units.
Go through them based on the instructions in the [**Schedule**](courseinfo/course-schedule.qmd)**.**

Each module comes with several assessments, which are tasks you are expected to do by the specified deadlines, and which are assessed/graded.
You will find a general explanation and assignments for each module in the [**Assessments**](courseinfo/assessments-overview.qmd) section.

The [**Project**](project/project-overview.qmd) section provides instructions and detailed information for the semester-long data analysis project which is part of the course.

The [**Resources**](resources/resources-overview.qmd) section contains a [**Course Resources**](resources/resources-course.qmd) document with listings of materials that are most relevant to the course.
Some of this material will assigned as part of this course.
You will be told what exactly to read or work through.
The [**General Resources**](resources/resources-general.qmd) section lists other resources in case you might find them helpful.
All materials are (should be) available freely online.
The [**Glossary**](resources/resources-glossary.qmd) section provides brief definitions of terms used in this course.

<!-- Note that by default, all links open in the current tab. You'll likely want external ones to open in a separate tab or window. To do so, you can (with most browsers) hold the `Ctrl` button when clicking, or do a right-click and select `open in new tab/window`. -->

# Getting started

Start by looking over the documents in the [**General Information**](courseinfo/course-overview.qmd) section, then the [**Resources**](resources/resources-overview.qmd) section.
After that, read the [**Assessments Overview**](courseinfo/assessments-overview.qmd) document.
Then start with the first [**Module**](content/content-overview.qmd) content in the given order.
You can read through the [**Project**](project/project-overview.qmd) section early or wait until you have gone through the first few modules.

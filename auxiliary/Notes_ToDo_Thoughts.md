## Quarto Conversion notes

Currently the time stamp in the Rmd YAML is auto-generated with:
date: "`r file.mtime(knitr::current_input())`"
This doesn't seem to work in Quarto. I would still like to have an auto-generated date. Ideally based on the last time the file was edited (and not as currently the date the file was-reknitted). 

I want the Quarto files to have (at least) these entries:
title: 
subtitle: (mostly empty)
author: 
date: last-modified-date

The bibliography entry can go, I decided to only do inline/link citations for this website, no bibliography/reference manager.

# ToDo

Could add more figures/diagrams. Especially module 11, and other fitting modules.

Add a tutorial on making simulated data

# Notes


# Scribblings

Write a tutorial explaining why and how to use simulated data to test a data analysis pipeline. Write a Quarto document combining markdown text with well-documented R code. The code should generate simulated data for 500 individuals. Include as variables age, height, weight, and 7 other variables. Make some of the variables continuous, some categorical and some text. Show code that generates the data by drawing from distributions. Then write code that loads the data and performs exploratory data analysis. Combine the code with text explanations.

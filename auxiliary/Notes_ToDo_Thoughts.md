Especially talk by Maria and examples linked in her slides

Update links/references to R4DS 2nd edition instead of 1st.

Write an AI and how to use it section.

# Notes




# Scribblings

Write a tutorial explaining why and how to use simulated data to test a data analysis pipeline. Write a Quarto document combining markdown text with well-documented R code. The code should generate simulated data for 500 individuals. Include as variables age, height, weight, and 7 other variables. Make some of the variables continuous, some categorical and some text. Show code that generates the data by drawing from distributions. Then write code that loads the data and performs exploratory data analysis. Combine the code with text explanations.

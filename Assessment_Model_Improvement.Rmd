# Quiz

Get the quiz sheet for this module from the general [__Assessments__](./Course_Assessments.html) page. Fill it in, then submit to the online grading system before the deadline. 


# Exercise

We definitely need to practice some of the topics we covered in this (and previous modules). But since at the end of the week there is another project deadline, I want you to focus on that. Thus no exercise this week, we'll practice the topics we covered in upcoming exercises.




# Discussion

Find a peer-reviewed paper where the authors use one or several of the approaches covered this week, and discuss if the authors properly explain and justify why they are doing what they are doing, and why you think what they are doing is or is not a good approach given their stated objective(s).

Post your discussion (with link to paper) by Wednesday, then read at least one other paper posted by your classmates and comment on it.

I tried to group them into themes and provide a bit of commentary. The focus is on generative AI tools.\n\n# Goals\nBy the end of the unit, you should:\n\n* Be aware of a few places where you can learn more about AI.\n\n\n\n# AI in general\n\n* [One Useful Thing](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/) is a Substack blog by Ethan Mollick where he discusses ideas around (generative) AI from a very applied user perspective. I read his writings regularly, and you might find a lot of what he wrote echoed in my writing, because that's where I get the ideas from üòÅ.\n\n\n* [Unconfuse Me](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Podcast) is a podcast by Bill Gates that covers all kinds of topics, but has a few interesting AI-themed ones, namely (as of this writing) episodes 2 and 5.\n\n\n# AI and teaching\n\n* [Wharton Interactive](https://interactive.wharton.upenn.edu/teaching-with-ai/) is an initiative by Ethan and Lilach Mollick and colleagues at Wharton that - among other things - looks at the use of AI for teaching and learning. The website contains some interesting ideas and links to papers that look further into AI use.\n\n\n# AI and Coding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

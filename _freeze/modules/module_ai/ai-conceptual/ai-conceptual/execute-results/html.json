So what's the point of producing synthatic (also often referred to as simulated or artificial or fake) data? There are several good reasons why this can sometimes be useful.\n\n\n# AI as the intern/1st year graduate\n\n\n# AI as electricity\n\n\n\n\n# Summary\n\nTo sum up,  important reasons to use synthetic data are:\n\n\n\n# Further Resources\n\nIn the next units, we will discuss how to actually generate synthetic data and how to use it.\n\n\n\n\n",

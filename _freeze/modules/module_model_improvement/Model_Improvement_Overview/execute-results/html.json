We generally want a model with good performance. To get such a model, there are several things we can do to either the data or the model to help improve performance.\n\nTrying different models is, of course, always an option, and possibly a good one. But even if we don't use lots of different models, there are often things we can do to improve the performance of the model (or type of model) we are using.\n\nWe are covering several important approaches to model performance improvement here. But as we go through these topics (and the rest of the course) always keep these things in mind: \n\n* __Good performance alone doesn't mean a model is good!__\n* __Good performance on a scientifically wrong metric is useless!__\n* __Good performance assessed with the data used to build the model is not too meaningful!__\n\n",

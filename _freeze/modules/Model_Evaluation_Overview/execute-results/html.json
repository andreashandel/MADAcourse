How do we know one model is _better_ than another? How do we know any given model is _good_? These questions, i.e., what model is _better_ among a group of models, and if a model is _good_ (even the best among a group of awful models can be a bad model!) have multiple parts to them, only some of which can be answered by statistics. Others are judgment calls. \n\nThere is no single way to define quality. Instead, multiple factors should be considered. Here are some important aspects to think about:\n\n* Model performance: How well do the predictions from the model compare to the actual data?\n* Model complexity: How easy or hard is it to understand the model? How fast does it run? How robust is it to violations of the assumptions you made?\n* Model uncertainty: How much uncertainty is associated with the predictions made by the model?\n* Model misspecification: How much systematic deviation is there between model predictions and actual data?\n\n\nWe will discuss these different ways one can assess model quality in this module.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The website will likely receive none or only minor updates until the next time the course will be offered (tentatively spring 2024).**_ -->\n\n<!-- **This course website is currently being updated for spring 2024. As long as this message is shown, consider the current website outdated, things will change (though likely not by much).** -->\n\n_**The course is currently running. The website will be updated throughout the semester. Things might change (though likely not by a whole lot). Visit/check regularly, especially the Schedule. Note the last update time above.**_\n\n# Website content\n\nThe [**General Information**](courseinfo/course-overview.qmd) section provides a class [**Syllabus**](courseinfo/course-syllabus.qmd) and a [**Schedule**](courseinfo/course-schedule.qmd).\nThe latter will likely be updated throughout the course, so check it regularly.\nThe [**Communication**](courseinfo/course-communication.qmd) page provides information on how course communications are planned to happen.\n\nThe majority of the content is listed under the [**Content**](content/content-overview.qmd) heading.\nThe content is split into modules.\nEach module contains several units.\nGo through them based on the instructions in the [**Schedule**](courseinfo/course-schedule.qmd)**.**\n\nEach module comes with several assessments, which are tasks you are expected to do by the specified deadlines, and which are assessed/graded.\nYou will find a general explanation and assignments for each module in the [**Assessments**](courseinfo/assessments-overview.qmd) section.\n\nThe [**Project**](project/project-overview.qmd) section provides instructions and detailed information for the semester-long data analysis project which is part of the course.\n\nThe [**Resources**](resources/resources-overview.qmd) section contains a [**Course Resources**](resources/resources-course.qmd) document with listings of materials that are most relevant to the course.\nSome of this material will assigned as part of this course.\nYou will be told what exactly to read or work through.\nThe [**General Resources**](resources/resources-general.qmd) section lists other resources in case you might find them helpful.\nAll materials are (should be) available freely online.\nThe [**Glossary**](resources/resources-glossary.qmd) section provides brief definitions of terms used in this course.\n\n<!-- Note that by default, all links open in the current tab. You'll likely want external ones to open in a separate tab or window. To do so, you can (with most browsers) hold the `Ctrl` button when clicking, or do a right-click and select `open in new tab/window`. -->\n\n# Getting started\n\nStart by looking over the documents in the [**General Information**](courseinfo/course-overview.qmd) section, then the [**Resources**](resources/resources-overview.qmd) section.\nAfter that, read the [**Assessments Overview**](courseinfo/assessments-overview.qmd) document.\nThen start with the first [**Module**](content/content-overview.qmd) content in the given order.\nYou can read through the [**Project**](project/project-overview.qmd) section early or wait until you have gone through the first few modules.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis course was developed and is maintained by [Andreas Handel](https://www.andreashandel.com/).\n\n\nThe following individuals have contributed to improving the course:\nIan Bachli ([\\@idbachli](https://github.com/idbachli)), Megan Beaudry ([\\@MeganSarah](https://github.com/MeganSarah)), Zane Billings ([\\@wzbillings](https://github.com/wzbillings)), Amanda Blubaugh ([\\@alblubaugh](https://github.com/alblubaugh)), Mia Carmichael ([\\@mncarmic](https://github.com/mncarmic)), Ellen Cheng ([\\@ellenmonster](https://github.com/ellenmonster)), Paige Duffin ([\\@paigeduffin](https://github.com/paigeduffin)), Robert Edenfield ([\\@ClaytonEdenfield](https://github.com/ClaytonEdenfield)), Julia Frederick ([\\@JuliaFrederick](https://github.com/JuliaFrederick)), Savannah Hammerton ([\\@smhammerton](https://github.com/smhammerton)), Megan Lott ([\\@meganejlott](https://github.com/meganejlott)), Yao Lu ([\\@yl3362](https://github.com/yl3362)), Brian McKay ([\\@bmckay](https://github.com/bmckay)), William Norfolk ([\\@williamnorfolk](https://github.com/williamnorfolk)), Trang Quach ([\\@TrangQuach](https://github.com/TrangQuach)), Emily Rayens ([\\@Rayense](https://github.com/Rayense)), Megan Robertson ([\\@meganjro](https://github.com/meganjro)), Jadey Ryan ([\\@jadeynryan](https://github.com/jadeynryan)), Amanda Skarlupka ([\\@askarlupka](https://github.com/askarlupka)), Jonathan Wilson ([\\@JJWilson1991](https://github.com/JJWilson1991)), Yang Zhang ([\\@yz17970](https://github.com/yz17970))\n\n\n<!-- Some icons come from [DesirÃ©e De Leon](https://desiree.rbind.io/post/2019/making-tip-boxes-with-bookdown-and-rmarkdown/). -->\n\nThe course materials are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).\nLinked and embedded materials are governed by their own licenses.\nI assume that all external materials used or embedded here are covered under the educational fair use policy.\nIf this is not the case and any material displayed here violates copyright, please let me know and I will remove it.\n",

I'm trying to reserve _evaluation_ when one has a clear performance metric that one can measure, for instance the mean squared error or the value of a likelihood function. I use the term _assessment_ in a broader sense. But I might not be consistent, so if you see either word, just figure out what is meant based on context 😁.\n\n\nIf we fit any kind of statistical model to data, we need to determine the quality of a fit somehow. How do we know one model is *better* than another? How do we know any given model is *good*? These questions, i.e., what model is *better* among a group of models, and if a model is *good* (even the best among a group of awful models can be a bad model!) have multiple parts to them, only some of which can be answered by statistics. Others are judgment calls.\n\nThere is no single way to define quality. Instead, multiple factors should be considered. Here are some important aspects to think about.\n\n\n## Agreement with reality\n\nFirst and foremost, you should ask yourself if a given model makes sense. If there's an obvious conflict between the model structure or the model results and reality, something can't be right about the model. This is where your subject matter expertise comes in. To be a good data analyst, you not only need statistical and data analysis skills, you should also know a fair bit about the system you are trying to study. If there's disagreement between model and reality, reality wins. Let's say, you used a model to explore pattern between children's age and height. Your model predicts that a 30 year old person will be 20 feet tall. You know this is not possible, therefore your model is likely not a very good one. In this case, you maybe extrapolated outside the range of where the model might be useful - a common occurrence. For this example, the solution is to either only use the model in the range where it was calibrated, or if you want to predict the height of a 30 year old person, you need to change your model. \n\nSo always think critically about the model and its results and ensure they pass the 'reality test'. Only if they do does it make sense to move to more narrow ways of assessing the model.\n\n\n## Model perfomance\n\nThis is generally the most clear-cut metric. After you define and quantify the metric you want to optimize, you can compare model performance among different models. We discussed some of those metrics before, such as RMSE or accuracy. Comparing those values among models can indicate which model is better. How exactly one should do that performance evaluation is something we'll discuss in later unit.\n\n\n\n## Predictions\n\nThe model performance metric gives you a single quantity describing how well the model matches the data, given the metric you defined. That's useful, but you generally want to dig deeper and look at how predictions from the model for individual observations compare to the actual data. You can do that best through various graphical methods, which we'll discuss in a later unit.\n\n\n## Uncertainty\n\nAny estimate you obtain from a model comes with uncertainty. You need to look at that uncertainty and decide if it is acceptable. You might have trade-offs. For instance you might have a model that provides a better performance as measured by your metric (say RMSE), but when you look at the uncertainty around the estimate, it might be larger than what you get from a smaller model. Which model to choose in such a case is a scientific question. It depends on your goals.\n\n\n## Complexity\n\nThere is often a trade-off between simple models that are easy to interpret but don't perform quite as well, and complex models that give better performance but that can be hard to interpret. More complex models also tend to take longer to execute, and might not generalize that well since they might be overly tuned to the data you used to build the model. Again, it is up to you to decide which model is more suitable for your purpose.\n\n\n\n## Usefulness\n\nUsefulness is in some sense the combination of the categories above. Based on what you want a model to do, you choose one (or multiple) that are most useful for your purpose.\n\nFor instance, if you want to build a model that allows doctors to predict the chance that a patient has a certain disease, you might want to have a model that only uses the fewest (or easiest/cheapest to measure) variables to obtain good performance. So if you collect a lot of data, some based on checking patient symptoms and some on lab results, you might not want to use all those variables in your model. Let's say that you had data on 10 predictors, 5 for easy to measure symptom variables (e.g., body temperature and similar), and 5 variables that come from different lab tests. You'll evaluate models with different predictors (performing e.g., subset selection or LASSO, which we'll discuss soon) and find that the best performing model retains 3 symptom variables and 2 lab tests. Let's say its performance is 95% (I'm purposefully fuzzy about what that performance exactly is since it doesn't matter). But you also find that another model that contains 4 symptom variables and no lab tests has 85% performance. Which do you choose? In this case, since you could get data on the 4 symptoms very quickly and cheaply, you might want to recommend that model for most doctors offices, and only use the better, but more time-consuming and expensive model with the 2 lab tests in settings such as high-risk populations in the hospital.\n\nIn contrast, if you are a bank that tries to predict fraud by having complicated models that constantly analyze various data streams, you might not care how complicated and big your model is, only that the performance in flagging fraudulent transactions is as good as possible.\n\n\n# Summary\n\nIt is very important to think critically about your models (and those of others). While some parts of model assessment are driven by statistics (e.g., the performance), others depend on your scientific and expert assessment. In the end, for better or for worse, you are in charge and need to make decisions, there are no easy recipes to follow. The addiction of the scientific community to simple recipes containing magical $p=0.05$ values and _statistical significance_ is completely misguided and unhelpful. \n\n\n# Further Resources\n\n* The [Advanced Data Science book](http://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/dsbook-part-2/) covers some of these topics.

Figure our the overall setting and the questions the study is trying to answer. Then look at the models. You might not be ready yet to fully assess and critique if they did things right, but just carefully pay attention to their model choices and how the papers do or don't address the aspects described above. \n\n\n\n\n",

  abstract    = {Heterogeneity in host contact patterns profoundly shapes population-level disease dynamics. Many epidemiological models make simplifying assumptions about the patterns of disease-causing interactions among hosts. In particular, homogeneous-mixing models assume that all hosts have identical rates of disease-causing contacts. In recent years, several network-based approaches have been developed to explicitly model heterogeneity in host contact patterns. Here, we use a network perspective to quantify the extent to which real populations depart from the homogeneous-mixing assumption, in terms of both the underlying network structure and the resulting epidemiological dynamics. We find that human contact patterns are indeed more heterogeneous than assumed by homogeneous-mixing models, but are not as variable as some have speculated. We then evaluate a variety of methodologies for incorporating contact heterogeneity, including network-based models and several modifications to the simple SIR compartmental model. We conclude that the homogeneous-mixing compartmental model is appropriate when host populations are nearly homogeneous, and can be modified effectively for a few classes of non-homogeneous networks. In general, however, network models are more intuitive and accurate for predicting disease spread through heterogeneous host populations.},

  abstract    = {Many pathogens spread primarily via direct contact between infected and susceptible hosts. Thus, the patterns of contacts or contact network of a population fundamentally shape the course of epidemics. While there is a robust and growing theory for the dynamics of single epidemics in networks, we know little about the impacts of network structure on long-term epidemic or endemic transmission. For seasonal diseases like influenza, pathogens repeatedly return to populations with complex and changing patterns of susceptibility and immunity acquired through prior infection. Here, we develop two mathematical approaches for modeling consecutive seasonal outbreaks of a partially-immunizing infection in a population with contact heterogeneity. Using methods from percolation theory we consider both leaky immunity, where all previously infected individuals gain partial immunity, and polarized immunity, where a fraction of previously infected individuals are fully immune. By restructuring the epidemiologically active portion of their host population, such diseases limit the potential of future outbreaks. We speculate that these dynamics can result in evolutionary pressure to increase infectiousness.},

  Abstract                 = {Biological diversity has long been used to measure ecological health. While evidence exists from many ecosystems that declines in host biodiversity may lead to greater risk of disease emergence, the role of pathogen diversity in the emergence process remains poorly understood. Particularly, because a more diverse pool of pathogen types provides more ways in which evolutionary innovations may arise, we suggest that host-pathogen systems with high pathogen diversity are more prone to disease emergence than systems with relatively homogeneous pathogen communities. We call this prediction the diversity-emergence hypothesis. To show how this hypothesis could be tested, we studied a system comprised of North American shorebirds and their associated low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses. These viruses are important as a potential source of genetic innovations in influenza. A theoretical contribution of this study is an expression predicting the rate of viral subtype reassortment to be proportional to both prevalence and Simpson's Index, a formula that has been used traditionally to quantify biodiversity. We then estimated prevalence and subtype diversity in host species at Delaware Bay, a North American AIV hotspot, and used our model to extrapolate from these data. We estimated that 4 to 39 virus subtypes circulated at Delaware Bay each year between 2000 and 2008, and that surveillance coverage (percentage of co-circulating subtypes collected) at Delaware Bay is only about 63.0\%. Simpson's Index in the same period varied more than fourfold from 0.22 to 0.93. These measurements together with the model provide an indirect, model-based estimate of the reassortment rate. A proper test of the diversity-emergence hypothesis would require these results to be joined to independent and reliable estimates of reassortment, perhaps obtained through molecular surveillance. These results suggest both that subtype diversity (and therefore reassortment) varies from year to year and that several subtypes contributing to reassortment are going undetected. The similarity between these results and more detailed studies of one host, ruddy turnstone (Arenaria interpres), further suggests that this species may be the primary host for influenza reassortment at Delaware Bay. Biological diversity has long been quantified using Simpson's Index. Our model links this formula to a mechanistic account of reassortment in multipathogen systems in the form of subtype diversity at Delaware Bay, USA. As a theory of how pathogen diversity may influence the evolution of novel pathogens, this work is a contribution to the larger project of understanding the connections between biodiversity and disease.},

  Abstract                 = {Transmission is the driving force in the dynamics of any infectious disease. A crucial element in understanding disease dynamics, therefore, is the 'transmission term' describing the rate at which susceptible hosts are 'converted' into infected hosts by their contact with infectious material. Recently, the conventional form of this term has been increasingly questioned, and new terminologies and conventions have been proposed. Here, therefore, we review the derivation of transmission terms, explain the basis of confusion, and provide clarification. The root of the problem has been a failure to include explicit consideration of the area occupied by a host population, alongside both the number of infectious hosts and their density within the population. We argue that the terms 'density-dependent transmission' and 'frequency-dependent transmission' remain valid and useful (though a 'fuller' transmission term for the former is identified), but that the terms 'mass action', 'true mass action' and 'pseudo mass action' are all unhelpful and should be dropped. Also, contrary to what has often been assumed, the distinction between homogeneous and heterogeneous mixing in a host population is orthogonal to the distinction between density- and frequency-dependent transmission modes.},

Attempts to explain the patterns of periodicity and persistence using simple direct transmission models are unsuccessful. Motivated by empirical evidence, we examine the contribution of an overlooked AIV transmission mode: environmental transmission. It is known that infectious birds shed large concentrations of virions in the environment, where virions may persist for a long time. We thus propose that, in addition to direct fecal/oral transmission, birds may become infected by ingesting virions that have long persisted in the environment. We design a new host-pathogen model that combines within-season transmission dynamics, between-season migration and reproduction, and environmental variation. Analysis of the model yields three major results. First, environmental transmission provides a persistence mechanism within small communities where epidemics cannot be sustained by direct transmission only (i.e., communities smaller than the critical community size). Second, environmental transmission offers a parsimonious explanation of the 2-4 year periodicity of avian influenza epidemics. Third, very low levels of environmental transmission (i.e., few cases per year) are sufficient for avian influenza to persist in populations where it would otherwise vanish.},

We establish the conditions under which a multi-strain endemic state is invaded by another strain which is both directly and environmentally transmitted. We discuss explicit forms for environmental transmission terms and apply our newly derived invasion conditions to a two-strain system. Then, we consider the case of two strains with matching basic reproduction numbers (i.e., R(0)), one directly transmitted only and the other both directly and environmentally transmitted, invading each other's endemic state. We find that the strain which is only directly transmitted can invade the endemic state of the strain with mixed transmission. However, the endemic state of the first strain is neutrally stable to invasion by the second strain. Thus, our results suggest that environmental transmission makes the endemic state less resistant to invasion.},

In a preliminary study, a recently developed commercial blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (bELISA) had sensitivity and specificity estimates of 82\% and 100\%, respectively, for detection of antibodies to AI virus in multiple wild bird species after experimental infection. To further evaluate the efficacy of this commercial bELISA and the agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) test for AI virus antibody detection in wild birds, we tested 2,249 serum samples collected from 62 wild bird species, representing 10 taxonomic orders. Overall, the bELISA detected 25.4\% positive samples, whereas the AGID test detected 14.8\%. At the species level, the bELISA detected as many or more positive serum samples than the AGID in all 62 avian species. The majority of positive samples, detected by both assays, were from species that use aquatic habitats, with the highest prevalence from species in the orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes. Conversely, antibodies to AI virus were rarely detected in the terrestrial species. The serologic data yielded by both assays are consistent with the known epidemiology of AI virus in wild birds and published reports of host range based on virus isolation and RT-PCR. The results of this research are also consistent with the aforementioned study, which evaluated the performance of the bELISA and AGID test on experimental samples. Collectively, the data from these two studies indicate that the bELISA is a more sensitive serologic assay than the AGID test for detecting prior exposure to AI virus in wild birds. Based on these results, the bELISA is a reliable species-independent assay with potentially valuable applications for wild bird AI surveillance.},

Ruddy turnstones (Arenaria interpres) are an atypical bird species in this regard, annually experiencing high AIV prevalence in only one location-Delaware Bay, USA, during their spring migration. While there, they congregate on beaches, attracted by the super-abundance of horseshoe crab eggs. A relationship between ruddy turnstone and horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus) population sizes has been established, with a declining horseshoe crab population linked to a corresponding drop in ruddy turnstone population sizes. The effect of this interaction on AIV prevalence in ruddy turnstones has also been addressed. Here, we employ a transmission model to investigate how the interaction between these two species is likely to be altered by climate change. We explore the consequences of this modified interaction on both ruddy turnstone population size and AIV prevalence and show that, if climate change leads to a large enough mismatch in species phenology, AIV prevalence in ruddy turnstones will increase even as their population size decreases.},

  Abstract                 = {Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) are considered a threat for their potential to seed human influenza pandemics. Despite their acknowledged importance, there are significant unknowns regarding AIV transmission dynamics in their natural hosts, wild birds. Of particular interest is the difference in subtype dynamics between human and bird populations-in human populations, typically only two or three subtypes cocirculate, while avian populations are capable of simultaneously hosting a multitude of subtypes. One species in particular-ruddy turnstones (Arenaria interpres)--has been found to harbour a very wide range of AIV subtypes, which could make them a key player in the spread of new subtypes in wild bird populations. Very little is known about the mechanisms that drive subtype dynamics in this species, and here we address this gap in our knowledge. Taking advantage of two independent sources of data collected from ruddy turnstones in Delaware Bay, USA, we examine patterns of subtype diversity and dominance at this site. We compare these patterns to those produced by a stochastic, multi-strain transmission model to investigate possible mechanisms that are parsimonious with the observed subtype dynamics. We find, in agreement with earlier experimental work, that subtype differences are unnecessary to replicate the observed dynamics, and that neutrality alone is sufficient. We also evaluate the role of subtype cross-immunity and find that it is not necessary to generate patterns consistent with observations. This work offers new insights into the mechanisms behind subtype diversity and dominance in a species that has the potential to be a key player in AIV dynamics in wild bird populations.},

  Abstract                 = {The basic reproduction number (0) is arguably the most important quantity in infectious disease epidemiology. The next-generation matrix (NGM) is the natural basis for the definition and calculation of (0) where finitely many different categories of individuals are recognized. We clear up confusion that has been around in the literature concerning the construction of this matrix, specifically for the most frequently used so-called compartmental models. We present a detailed easy recipe for the construction of the NGM from basic ingredients derived directly from the specifications of the model. We show that two related matrices exist which we define to be the NGM with large domain and the NGM with small domain. The three matrices together reflect the range of possibilities encountered in the literature for the characterization of (0). We show how they are connected and how their construction follows from the basic model ingredients, and establish that they have the same non-zero eigenvalues, the largest of which is the basic reproduction number (0). Although we present formal recipes based on linear algebra, we encourage the construction of the NGM by way of direct epidemiological reasoning, using the clear interpretation of the elements of the NGM and of the model ingredients. We present a selection of examples as a practical guide to our methods. In the appendix we present an elementary but complete proof that (0) defined as the dominant eigenvalue of the NGM for compartmental systems and the Malthusian parameter r, the real-time exponential growth rate in the early phase of an outbreak, are connected by the properties that (0) > 1 if and only if r > 0, and (0) = 1 if and only if r = 0.},

  abstract =    {Neuraminidase Inhibitors (NI) are currently the most effective drugs against influenza. Recent cases of NI resistance are a cause for concern. To assess the danger of NI resistance, a number of studies have reported the fraction of treated patients from which resistant strains could be isolated. Unfortunately, those results strongly depend on the details of the experimental protocol. Additionally, knowing the fraction of patients harboring resistance is not too useful by itself. Instead, we want to know how likely it is that an infected patient can generate a resistant infection in a secondary host, and how likely it is that the resistant strain subsequently spreads. While estimates for these parameters can often be obtained from epidemiological data, such data is lacking for NI resistance in influenza. Here, we use an approach that does not rely on epidemiological data. Instead, we combine data from influenza infections of human volunteers with a mathematical framework that allows estimation of the parameters that govern the initial generation and subsequent spread of resistance. We show how these parameters are influenced by changes in drug efficacy, timing of treatment, fitness of the resistant strain, and details of virus and immune system dynamics. Our study provides estimates for parameters that can be directly used in mathematical and computational models to study how NI usage might lead to the emergence and spread of resistance in the population. We find that the initial generation of resistant cases is most likely lower than the fraction of resistant cases reported. However, we also show that the results depend strongly on the details of the within-host dynamics of influenza infections, and most importantly, the role the immune system plays. Better knowledge of the quantitative dynamics of the immune response during influenza infections will be crucial to further improve the results.},

Both during seasonal and pandemic influenza outbreaks, morbidity and mortality due to secondary bacterial infections can be substantial. With the help of a mathematical model, we investigate the potential impact of such bacterial infections during an influenza pandemic, and we analyze how antiviral and antibacterial treatment or prophylaxis affect morbidity and mortality. We consider different scenarios for the spread of bacteria, the emergence of antiviral resistance, and different levels of severity for influenza infections (1918-like and 2009-like). We find that while antibacterial intervention strategies are unlikely to play an important role in reducing the overall number of cases, such interventions can lead to a significant reduction in mortality and in the number of bacterial infections. Antibacterial interventions become even more important if one considers the--very likely--scenario that during a pandemic outbreak, influenza strains resistant to antivirals emerge. Overall, our study suggests that pandemic preparedness plans should consider intervention strategies based on antibacterial treatment or prophylaxis through drugs or vaccines as part of the overall control strategy. A major caveat for our results is the lack of data that would allow precise estimation of many of the model parameters. As our results show, this leads to very large uncertainty in model outcomes. As we discuss, precise assessment of the impact of antibacterial strategies during an influenza pandemic will require the collection of further data to better estimate key parameters, especially those related to the bacterial infections and the impact of antibacterial intervention strategies.},

  Abstract                 = {Successful replication within an infected host and successful transmission between hosts are key to the continued spread of most pathogens. Competing selection pressures exerted at these different scales can lead to evolutionary trade-offs between the determinants of fitness within and between hosts. Here, we examine such a trade-off in the context of influenza A viruses and the differential pressures exerted by temperature-dependent virus persistence. For a panel of avian influenza A virus strains, we find evidence for a trade-off between the persistence at high versus low temperatures. Combining a within-host model of influenza infection dynamics with a between-host transmission model, we study how such a trade-off affects virus fitness on the host population level. We show that conclusions regarding overall fitness are affected by the type of link assumed between the within- and between-host levels and the main route of transmission (direct or environmental). The relative importance of virulence and immune response mediated virus clearance are also found to influence the fitness impacts of virus persistence at low versus high temperatures. Based on our results, we predict that if transmission occurs mainly directly and scales linearly with virus load, and virulence or immune responses are negligible, the evolutionary pressure for influenza viruses to evolve toward good persistence at high within-host temperatures dominates. For all other scenarios, influenza viruses with good environmental persistence at low temperatures seem to be favored.},

  Abstract                 = {Trade-offs between different components of a pathogen's replication and transmission cycle are thought to be common. A number of studies have identified trade-offs that emerge across scales, reflecting the tension between strategies that optimize within-host proliferation and large-scale population spread. Most of these studies are theoretical in nature, with direct experimental tests of such cross-scale trade-offs still rare. Here, we report an analysis of avian influenza A viruses across scales, focusing on the phenotype of temperature-dependent viral persistence. Taking advantage of a unique dataset that reports both environmental virus decay rates and strain-specific viral kinetics from duck challenge experiments, we show that the temperature-dependent environmental decay rate of a strain does not impact within-host virus load. Hence, for this phenotype, the scales of within-host infection dynamics and between-host environmental persistence do not seem to interact: viral fitness may be optimized on each scale without cross-scale trade-offs. Instead, we confirm the existence of a temperature-dependent persistence trade-off on a single scale, with some strains favouring environmental persistence in water at low temperatures while others reduce sensitivity to increasing temperatures. We show that this temperature-dependent trade-off is a robust phenomenon and does not depend on the details of data analysis. Our findings suggest that viruses might employ different environmental persistence strategies, which facilitates the coexistence of diverse strains in ecological niches. We conclude that a better understanding of the transmission and evolutionary dynamics of influenza A viruses probably requires empirical information regarding both within-host dynamics and environmental traits, integrated within a combined ecological and within-host framework.},

We present a conceptual framework and provide examples of studies that have taken first steps towards development of a quantitative framework that scales from within-host infections to population-level fitness of different pathogens.

To evaluate the effect of pH, salinity, and temperature on AIV persistence in natural surface water, we measured the duration of infectivity for two common low pathogenic AIV subtypes in 15 filtered surface water samples collected from major waterfowl habitats in Georgia, USA. Trials were performed at three incubation temperatures 10, 17, and 28 C. Consistent with previous studies, pH and temperature had a significant effect on the stability of AIV in filtered surface water. Both viruses were less stable at warmer temperatures and in acidic water (pH <5.0). Due to the limited range of salinity of the field water samples, the role of salinity in AIV stability in surface water could not adequately be evaluated. Variations in persistence times between water samples with comparable pH and salinities indicated that other factors affect AIV stability in natural surface water. These results contribute to the current understanding of AIV persistence in aquatic habitats and may help in identifying areas with an increased likelihood of AIV persistence and potential transmission.},

  Abstract                 = {The persistence of influenza A (IA) virus in aquatic habitats has been demonstrated to be a determinant for virus transmission dynamics in wild duck populations. In this study, we investigated virus strain-related variation in persistence in water for nine wild duck isolated IA viruses of three subtypes (H3N8, H4N6, and H8N4).We experimentally estimated the loss of infectivity over time in three different types of water: distilled, filtered surface water, and intact surface water. All viruses persisted longest in distilled water followed by filtered surface water with markedly reduced durations of persistence observed in the intact surface water. Strain-related variations were observed in distilled and filtered surface water but limited variation was observed in the intact surface water.Our findings suggest that the role of surface water for long-term (between years) maintenance of AI viruses in the environment may be limited, and suggest that the physico-chemical characteristics of water, as well as microorganisms, may be of strong importance. Results also indicate that the extent of strain-related variation observed in distilled water may overestimate persistence abilities for IA viruses in the wild and supports the need to develop experiments that account for these effects to assess subtype, genotype, as well as spatial and temporal variation in the persistence of IA viruses in aquatic habitats.},

  Abstract                 = {Avian influenza (AI) virus can remain infectious in water for months, and virus-contaminated surface water is considered to be a source of infection within wild waterfowl populations. Previous work has characterized the effects of pH, salinity, and temperature on viral persistence in water, but most of that work was done with modified distilled water. The objective of this study was to identify the abiotic factors that influence the duration of AI virus persistence in natural surface water. Surface water samples were collected from 38 waterfowl habitats distributed across the United States. Samples were submitted to the U.S. Geological Survey National Water Quality Laboratory for chemical analysis and the University of Georgia for viral reduction time analysis. Samples were filtered with 0.22-?m filters, and the durations of persistence of three wild-bird-derived influenza A viruses within each water sample at 10, 17, and 28°C were determined. The effects of the surface water physicochemical factors on the duration of AI viral persistence in laboratory experiments were evaluated by multivariable linear regression with robust standard errors. The duration of AI virus persistence was determined to be longest in filtered surface water with a low temperature (<17°C), a neutral-to-basic pH (7.0 to 8.5), low salinity (<0.5 ppt), and a low ammonia concentration (<0.5 mg/liter). Our results also highlighted potential strain-related variation in the stability of AI virus in surface water. These results bring us closer to being able to predict the duration of AI virus persistence in surface water of waterfowl habitats.},

Recently, the use of constant infectious and incubation periods, rather than the more convenient exponential forms, has been presented as a simple means of obtaining realistic persistence levels. However, this result appears at odds with rigorous mathematical theory; here we reconcile these differences. Using a deterministic approach, we parameterize a variety of models to fit the observed biennial attractor, thus determining the level of seasonality by the choice of model. We can then compare fairly the persistence of the stochastic versions of these models, using the 'best-fit' parameters. Finally, we consider the differences between the observed fade-out pattern and the more theoretically appealing 'first passage time'.},

  abstract =    {Networks and the epidemiology of directly transmitted infectious diseases are fundamentally linked. The foundations of epidemiology and early epidemiological models were based on population wide random-mixing, but in practice each individual has a finite set of contacts to whom they can pass infection; the ensemble of all such contacts forms a 'mixing network'. Knowledge of the structure of the network allows models to compute the epidemic dynamics at the population scale from the individual-level behaviour of infections. Therefore, characteristics of mixing networks-and how these deviate from the random-mixing norm-have become important applied concerns that may enhance the understanding and prediction of epidemic patterns and intervention measures. Here, we review the basis of epidemiological theory (based on random-mixing models) and network theory (based on work from the social sciences and graph theory). We then describe a variety of methods that allow the mixing network, or an approximation to the network, to be ascertained. It is often the case that time and resources limit our ability to accurately find all connections within a network, and hence a generic understanding of the relationship between network structure and disease dynamics is needed. Therefore, we review some of the variety of idealized network types and approximation techniques that have been utilized to elucidate this link. Finally, we look to the future to suggest how the two fields of network theory and epidemiological modelling can deliver an improved understanding of disease dynamics and better public health through effective disease control.},

  Abstract                 = {Water-borne transmission has been suggested as an important transmission mechanism for Influenza A (IA) viruses in wild duck populations; however, relatively few studies have attempted to detect IA viruses from aquatic habitats. Water-isolated viruses have rarely been genetically characterized and evaluation for persistence in water and infectivity in natural hosts has never been documented. In this study, we focused on two IA viruses (H3N8 and H4N6 subtypes) isolated from surface lake water in Minnesota, USA. We investigated the relative prevalence of the two virus subtypes in wild duck populations at the sampling site and their genetic relatedness to IA viruses isolated in wild waterbirds in North America. Viral persistence under different laboratory conditions (temperature and pH) and replication in experimentally infected Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were also characterized. Both viruses were the most prevalent subtype one year following their isolation in lake water. The viruses persisted in water for an extended time period at constant temperature (several weeks) but infectivity rapidly reduced under multiple freeze-thaw cycles. Furthermore, the two isolates efficiently replicated in Mallards. The complete genome characterization supported that these isolates originated from genetic reassortments with other IA viruses circulating in wild duck populations during the year of sampling. Based on phylogenetic analyses, we couldn't identify genetically similar viruses in duck populations in the years following their isolation from lake water. Our study supports the role for water-borne transmission for IA viruses but also highlights that additional field and experimental studies are required to support inter-annual persistence in aquatic habitats.},

  abstract =    {Population-level analyses often use average quantities to describe heterogeneous systems, particularly when variation does not arise from identifiable groups. A prominent example, central to our current understanding of epidemic spread, is the basic reproductive number, R(0), which is defined as the mean number of infections caused by an infected individual in a susceptible population. Population estimates of R(0) can obscure considerable individual variation in infectiousness, as highlighted during the global emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by numerous 'superspreading events' in which certain individuals infected unusually large numbers of secondary cases. For diseases transmitted by non-sexual direct contacts, such as SARS or smallpox, individual variation is difficult to measure empirically, and thus its importance for outbreak dynamics has been unclear. Here we present an integrated theoretical and statistical analysis of the influence of individual variation in infectiousness on disease emergence. Using contact tracing data from eight directly transmitted diseases, we show that the distribution of individual infectiousness around R(0) is often highly skewed. Model predictions accounting for this variation differ sharply from average-based approaches, with disease extinction more likely and outbreaks rarer but more explosive. Using these models, we explore implications for outbreak control, showing that individual-specific control measures outperform population-wide measures. Moreover, the dramatic improvements achieved through targeted control policies emphasize the need to identify predictive correlates of higher infectiousness. Our findings indicate that superspreading is a normal feature of disease spread, and to frame ongoing discussion we propose a rigorous definition for superspreading events and a method to predict their frequency.},

  Abstract                 = {The 1918 influenza pandemic killed 20-40 million people worldwide, and is seen as a worst-case scenario for pandemic planning. Like other pandemic influenza strains, the 1918 A/H1N1 strain spread extremely rapidly. A measure of transmissibility and of the stringency of control measures required to stop an epidemic is the reproductive number, which is the number of secondary cases produced by each primary case. Here we obtained an estimate of the reproductive number for 1918 influenza by fitting a deterministic SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model to pneumonia and influenza death epidemic curves from 45 US cities: the median value is less than three. The estimated proportion of the population with A/H1N1 immunity before September 1918 implies a median basic reproductive number of less than four. These results strongly suggest that the reproductive number for 1918 pandemic influenza is not large relative to many other infectious diseases. In theory, a similar novel influenza subtype could be controlled.

  Abstract                 = {Wild birds are the primary source of genetic diversity for influenza A viruses that eventually emerge in poultry and humans. Much progress has been made in the descriptive ecology of avian influenza viruses (AIVs), but contributions are less evident from quantitative studies (e.g., those including disease dynamic models). Transmission between host species, individuals and flocks has not been measured with sufficient accuracy to allow robust quantitative evaluation of alternate control protocols. We focused on the United States of America (USA) as a case study for determining the state of our quantitative knowledge of potential AIV emergence processes from wild hosts to poultry. We identified priorities for quantitative research that would build on existing tools for responding to AIV in poultry and concluded that the following knowledge gaps can be addressed with current empirical data: (1) quantification of the spatio-temporal relationships between AIV prevalence in wild hosts and poultry populations, (2) understanding how the structure of different poultry sectors impacts within-flock transmission, (3) determining mechanisms and rates of between-farm spread, and (4) validating current policy-decision tools with data. The modeling studies we recommend will improve our mechanistic understanding of potential AIV transmission patterns in USA poultry, leading to improved measures of accuracy and reduced uncertainty when evaluating alternative control strategies.},

Much of the distinguished evolutionary theory has, however, focused on each of transmission component separately. Herein, we use the framework of adaptive dynamics to study the evolutionary consequences of mixed transmission. We find that environmental transmission can select for increased virulence when direct transmission is low. Increasing the efficiency of direct transmission gives rise to an evolutionary bi-stability, with coexistence of different levels of virulence. We conclude that the overlooked contribution of environmental transmission may explain the curious appearance of high virulence in pathogens that are typically only moderately pathogenic, as observed for avian influenza viruses and cholera.},

  Abstract                 = {Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have been pivotal to the origination of human pandemic strains. Despite their scientific and public health significance, however, there remains much to be understood about the ecology and evolution of AIVs in wild birds, where major pools of genetic diversity are generated and maintained. Here, we present comparative phylodynamic analyses of human and AIVs in North America, demonstrating (i) significantly higher standing genetic diversity and (ii) phylogenetic trees with a weaker signature of immune escape in AIVs than in human viruses. To explain these differences, we performed statistical analyses to quantify the relative contribution of several potential explanations. We found that HA genetic diversity in avian viruses is determined by a combination of factors, predominantly subtype-specific differences in host immune selective pressure and the ecology of transmission (in particular, the durability of subtypes in aquatic environments). Extending this analysis using a computational model demonstrated that virus durability may lead to long-term, indirect chains of transmission that, when coupled with a short host lifespan, can generate and maintain the observed high levels of genetic diversity. Further evidence in support of this novel finding was found by demonstrating an association between subtype-specific environmental durability and predicted phylogenetic signatures: genetic diversity, variation in phylogenetic tree branch lengths, and tree height. The conclusion that environmental transmission plays an important role in the evolutionary biology of avian influenza viruses-a manifestation of the "storage effect"-highlights the potentially unpredictable impact of wildlife reservoirs for future human pandemics and the need for improved understanding of the natural ecology of these viruses.},

The current paradigm locates all important transmission events on the nearly direct fecal/oral bird-to-bird pathway. In this article, on the basis of overlooked evidence, we propose that an environmental virus reservoir gives rise to indirect transmission. This transmission mode could play an important epidemiological role. Using a stochastic model, we demonstrate how neglecting environmentally generated transmission chains could underestimate the explosiveness and duration of AIV epidemics. We show the important pathogen invasion implications of this phenomenon: the nonnegligible probability of outbreak even when direct transmission is absent, the long-term infectivity of locations of prior outbreaks, and the role of environmental heterogeneity in risk.},

A recent reanalysis of laboratory experiments indicates that absolute humidity strongly modulates the airborne survival and transmission of the influenza virus. Here, we extend these findings to the human population level, showing that the onset of increased wintertime influenza-related mortality in the United States is associated with anomalously low absolute humidity levels during the prior weeks. We then use an epidemiological model, in which observed absolute humidity conditions temper influenza transmission rates, to successfully simulate the seasonal cycle of observed influenza-related mortality. The model results indicate that direct modulation of influenza transmissibility by absolute humidity alone is sufficient to produce this observed seasonality. These findings provide epidemiological support for the hypothesis that absolute humidity drives seasonal variations of influenza transmission in temperate regions.},

Based on the statistical and mathematical analysis of vital statistics and morbidity epidemic curves in these two countries, we show that the 1951 epidemic was associated with both higher mortality impact and higher transmissibility than the 1957 and 1968 pandemics. Surprisingly in Liverpool, considered the 'epicenter' of the severe 1951 epidemic, the mortality impact and transmissibility even surpassed the 1918 pandemic.},

Theoretical models and epidemiologic data showed that the prevalence of gonorrhea adjusts rapidly to changes in social behavior, medical treatment, and control programs, that prevalence oscillates seasonally around an equilibrium state determined by the current social and medical conditions, and that this equilibrium moves as epidemiologic conditions change. The incidence of gonorrhea is theoretically limited by saturation in a sexually active core population, and this core causes gonorrhea to remain endemic.},

  abstract   = {The immune system can remember, sometimes for a lifetime, the identity of a pathogen. Understanding how this is accomplished has fascinated immunologists and microbiologists for many years, but there is still considerable debate regarding the mechanisms by which long-term immunity is maintained. Some of the controversy stems from a failure to distinguish between effector and memory cells and to define their roles in conferring protection against disease. Here the current understanding of the cellular basis of immune memory is reviewed and the relative contributions made to protective immunity by memory and effector T and B cells are examined.},

  abstract   = {Vaccination is one of the most effective methods used for protecting the public against infectious disease. Vaccines can be segregated into two general categories: replicating vaccines (i.e., live, attenuated vaccines) and non-replicating vaccines (e.g., inactivated or subunit vaccines). It has been assumed that live attenuated vaccines are superior to non-replicating vaccines in terms of the quality of the antiviral immune response, the level of protective immunity, and the duration of protective immunity. Although this a prevalent viewpoint within the field, there are several exceptions to the rule. Here, we will explore the historical literature in which some of these conclusions have been based, including {â€œExperiments} of Natureâ€� and describe examples of the efficacy of replicating vaccines compared to their non-replicating counterparts. By building a better understanding of how successful vaccines work, we hope to develop better â€œnext-generationâ€� vaccines as well as new vaccines against {HIVâ€”a} pathogen of global importance for which no licensed vaccine currently exists.},

The median peak amount of virus shedding was 95 x 10(9) (range 0.5-1,640 x 10(9)) genomic copies/g feces as measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Virus shedding was first detected by antigen ELISA approximately 33 hours (median 42 hours) after inoculation and lasted 10 days (median 7 days) after inoculation.

  abstract    = {Noroviruses cause epidemic and sporadic acute gastroenteritis. No vaccine is available to prevent norovirus illness or infection.We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial to assess the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of an investigational, intranasally delivered norovirus viruslike particle (VLP) vaccine (with chitosan and monophosphoryl lipid A as adjuvants) to prevent acute viral gastroenteritis after challenge with a homologous viral strain, Norwalk virus (genotype GI.1). Healthy adults 18 to 50 years of age received two doses of either vaccine or placebo and were subsequently inoculated with Norwalk virus and monitored for infection and gastroenteritis symptoms.Ninety-eight persons were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive vaccine (50 participants) or placebo (48 participants), and 90 received both doses (47 participants in the vaccine group and 43 in the placebo group). The most commonly reported symptoms after vaccination were nasal stuffiness, nasal discharge, and sneezing. Adverse events occurred with similar frequency among vaccine and placebo recipients. A Norwalk virus-specific IgA seroresponse (defined as an increase by a factor of 4 in serum antibody levels) was detected in 70\% of vaccine recipients. Seventy-seven of 84 participants inoculated with Norwalk virus were included in the per-protocol analysis. Vaccination significantly reduced the frequencies of Norwalk virus gastroenteritis (occurring in 69\% of placebo recipients vs. 37\% of vaccine recipients, P=0.006) and Norwalk virus infection (82\% of placebo recipients vs. 61\% of vaccine recipients, P=0.05).This norovirus VLP vaccine provides protection against illness and infection after challenge with a homologous virus.

  abstract    = {Human caliciviruses, noroviruses in particular, are a common cause of gastroenteritis in persons of all age groups. Although both antigen detection and serologic methods for diagnosis of infection with these viruses have been described, the best and most common methods used for diagnosis are molecular assays. Traditional RT-PCR methods are commonly used for diagnosis, but these require the use of a confirmatory test (such as probe hybridization or sequencing of amplicons). More recently, real-time RT-PCR assays have been developed that allow the rapid and accurate identification of caliciviruses in fecal samples. There is no single primer set that allows the detection of all strains within a calicivirus species, and separate primer pairs are generally used to identify strains belonging to different norovirus genogroups. Inhibition of nucleic acid amplification by substances contained within fecal samples is a common problem facing the diagnostician, but protocols to effectively remove the majority of such inhibitors have now been developed. This chapter describes methods for sample collection and processing of fecal specimens for molecular detection of enteric viruses, and it also describes both traditional and real-time RT-PCR assays for norovirus diagnosis.},

An understanding of the infectious dose of these viruses is important for risk assessment studies. Healthy adults were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of different dosages of Norwalk virus. Eligible subjects were monitored for clinical gastroenteritis, and infection status was determined. The presence of virus in vomitus was also assessed. Fifty-seven persons were enrolled; 8 received placebo and an additional 8 persons were considered to be nonsusceptible on the basis of being secretor negative. Twenty-one persons were infected (all blood group O or A), and 67\% of those infected developed viral gastroenteritis. The 50\% human infectious dose was calculated to be 3.3 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction units (approximately 1320 genomic equivalents [gEq]) for secretor-positive blood group O or A persons and 7.0 (approximately 2800 gEq) for all secretor-positive persons. The time of illness onset was inversely correlated with inoculum dose. The maximal concentration of virus shedding was higher for persons with gastroenteritis. Norwalk virus was identified in 15 of 27 (56\%) vomitus samples at a median concentration of 41 000 gEq/mL. The 50\% human infectious dose measured is higher than previous estimates and similar to that of other RNA viruses.

  abstract    = {Noroviruses are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide, and norovirus vaccine prevention strategies are under evaluation. The immunogenicity of two doses of bivalent genogroup 1 genotype 1 (GI.1)/GII.4 (50 μg of virus-like particles [VLPs] of each strain adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide and 3-O-desacyl-4'monophosphoryl lipid A [MPL]) norovirus vaccine administered to healthy adults in a phase 1/2 double-blind placebo-controlled trial was determined using virus-specific serum total antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), IgG, IgA, and histoblood group antigen (HBGA)-blocking assays. Trial participants subsequently received an oral live virus challenge with a GII.4 strain, and the vaccine efficacy results were reported previously (D. I. Bernstein et al., J Infect Dis 211:870-878, 2014, doi:10.1093/infdis/jiu497). This report assesses the impact of prechallenge serum antibody levels on infection and illness outcomes. Serum antibody responses were observed in vaccine recipients by all antibody assays, with first-dose seroresponse frequencies ranging from 88 to 100\% for the GI.1 antigen and from 69 to 84\% for the GII.4 antigen. There was little increase in antibody levels after the second vaccine dose. Among the subjects receiving the placebo, higher prechallenge serum anti-GII.4 HBGA-blocking and IgA antibody levels, but not IgG or total antibody levels, were associated with a lower frequency of virus infection and associated illness. Notably, some placebo subjects without measurable serum antibody levels prechallenge did not become infected after norovirus challenge. In vaccinees, anti-GII.4 HBGA-blocking antibody levels of >1:500 were associated with a lower frequency of moderate-to-severe vomiting or diarrheal illness. In this study, prechallenge serum HBGA antibody titers correlated with protection in subjects receiving the placebo; however, other factors may impact the likelihood of infection and illness after virus exposure.

Reactions were mainly mild to moderate, the most frequent being transient pain, in 8\%, 64\%, and 73\% of placebo, 15/50, and 50/50 groups, respectively; transient myalgia, headache, and fatigue were the commonest systemic adverse events. Subjects assessed per protocol (n = 442) displayed rapid immune responses to vaccination, peaking by days 7-10 and persisting through day 28. GI.1 responses were highest with the 50/50 formulation, but GII.4 responses were higher with the 15/50 formulation.Both candidate VLP vaccines were well tolerated and elicited robust immune responses by 7-10 days that persisted through day 28.

  abstract    = {A procedure for the detection of enteric viral nucleic acid in oysters by the polymerase chain reaction was developed. Known quantities of poliovirus type 1 were seeded into oysters. Virus was extracted and concentrated by using organic flocculation and polyethylene glycol precipitation. Inhibitors of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were present in the oyster extracts, preventing amplification of target viral nucleic acid. The use of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide precipitation sufficiently removed inhibitors to allow detection of as few as 10 PFU of poliovirus. Norwalk virus also could be detected after being seeded into oysters. This methodology may be useful for the detection of these and other shellfish-borne viral pathogens.},

Virus was added to the stomach and hepatopancreatic tissues of oysters or hard-shell clams, and viral nucleic acids were purified by a modification of a previously described method (R.L. Atmar, T.G. Metcalf, F.H. Neill, and M.K. Estes, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 59:631-635, 1993). The new method had the following advantages compared with the previously described method: (i) more rapid sample processing; (ii) increased test sensitivity; (iii) decreased sample-associated interference with reverse transcription-PCR; and (iv) use of chloroform-butanol in place of the chlorofluorocarbon trichlorotrifluoroethane. In addition, internal standards for both Norwalk virus and hepatitis A virus were made which demonstrated when inhibitors to reverse transcription-PCR were present and allowed quantitation of the viral nucleic acids present in samples. This assay can be used to investigate shellfish-associated gastroenteritis outbreaks and to study factors involved in virus persistence in shellfish.},

  abstract  = {Currently, little is known about the viral kinetics of influenza A during infection within an individual. We utilize a series of mathematical models of increasing complexity, which incorporate target cell limitation and the innate interferon response, to examine influenza A virus kinetics in the upper respiratory tracts of experimentally infected adults. The models were fit to data from an experimental {H1N1} influenza {A/Hong} Kong/123/77 infection and suggest that it is important to include the eclipse phase of the viral life cycle in viral dynamic models. Doing so, we estimate that after a delay of similar to 6 h, infected cells begin producing influenza virus and continue to do so for similar to 5 h. The average lifetime of infected cells is similar to 11 h, and the half-life of free infectious virus is similar to 3 h. We calculated the basic reproductive number, R, which indicated that a single infected cell could produce similar to 22 new productive infections. This suggests that antiviral treatments have a large hurdle to overcome in moderating symptoms and limiting infectiousness and that treatment has to be initiated as early as possible. For about 50\% of patients, the curve of viral titer versus time has two peaks. This bimodal behavior can be explained by incorporating the antiviral effects of interferon into the model. Our model also compared well to an additional data set on viral titer after experimental infection and treatment with the neuraminidase inhibitor zanamivir, which suggests that such models may prove useful in estimating the efficacies of different antiviral therapies for influenza A infection.},

Dose and kinetics of response were evaluated in the presence and absence of the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin (CT). rNV-specific serum IgG and intestinal IgA were detected in the absence of CT, and the number of responders was not significantly different from that of mice administered VLPs with CT at most doses. The use of CT was associated with induction of higher levels of IgG in serum; this effect was greater at higher doses of VLPs. IgG in serum was detected in the majority of animals by 9 days postimmunization (dpi), and intestinal IgA responses were detected by 24 dpi. In the absence of CT, IgG2b was the dominant IgG subclass response in both mouse strains. Thus, nonreplicating rNV VLPs are immunogenic when administered orally in the absence of any delivery system or mucosal adjuvant. These studies demonstrate that rNV VLPs are an excellent model to study the oral delivery of antigen, and they are a potential mucosal vaccine for NV infections.},

Here, we investigate mathematical modeling of influenza infection spread at a different scale; namely that occurring within an individual host or a cell culture. We review the models that have been developed in the last decades and discuss their contributions to our understanding of the dynamics of influenza infections. We review kinetic parameters (e.g., viral clearance rate, lifespan of infected cells) and values obtained through fitting mathematical models, and contrast them with values obtained directly from experiments. We explore the symbiotic role of mathematical models and experimental assays in improving our quantitative understanding of influenza infection dynamics. We also discuss the challenges in developing better, more comprehensive models for the course of influenza infections within a host or cell culture. Finally, we explain the contributions of such modeling efforts to important public health issues, and suggest future modeling studies that can help to address additional questions relevant to public health.},

Solicited adverse events (SEs) and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) were recorded during days 0 to 28 after each dose. Nasal wash samples were collected 3 times (days 7-10, 12-18, and 28-34) after each dose and at unscheduled illness visits. Blood for antibody response was collected at baseline and 28 days after each dose. Subjects were followed for 180 days after the last dose or to the end of the RSV season.Overall, there was no difference in the incidence of SEs and AEs between the RSV/PIV3 vaccine and placebo arms. Runny/stuffy nose was the most commonly reported SE. Medically attended lower respiratory illness rates were balanced between treatment arms, and there was no evidence of enhanced RSV disease or vaccine-related serious AEs. Vaccine virus was detected in most vaccinees on days 7 to 10 after dose 1 in a dose-dependent manner. Seroresponse to RSV and PIV3 was highest in subjects receiving the 10 dosage.The safety profile and vaccine take as measured by shedding and/or seroresponse in this RSV/PIV3-seronegative pediatric population support the continued development of this RSV/PIV3 pediatric vaccine candidate.},

  abstract  = {We present an approach to studying theoretically the regularities and the kinetic characteristics of influenza A virus {(IAV)} infection in man. The estimates of the "numbers" {(Zinkernagel} et al., 1985) characterizing evolutionary established interferon and immune responses in uncomplicated {IAV} infection are explored by developing a multiparameter mathematical model which allows direct quantitative references to the biological reality. The system of equations of the mathematical model of antiviral immune response, applied earlier to acute hepatitis B virus infection {(Marchuk} et al., 1991a, b), is modified and extended to describe the joint reaction of the interferon and immune systems in {IAV} infection. Macrophages infiltrating the airway's epithelium are considered to be the principal source of interferon that induces antiviral resistance in lung epithelial cells. The model is formulated as a delay-differential system with about 60 parameters characterizing the rates of various processes contributing to the typical course of {IAV} infection. The key aspect of the adjustment between the model and various data on the immunity to influenza is the derivation of a consistent data setâ€”the generalized picture of uncomplicated {IAV} infection. It serves as a consistent theoretical definition of the structure of the normal course of the infection and the antiviral immune response suitable for model fitting. The parameter estimates for the processes considered in the model are carefully discussed. The quantitative model is used to study the organization and dynamic properties of the processes contributing to {IAV} infection. The threshold condition for immune protection of virus-free host to infection with {IAV} is analyzed. The relative roles of humoral, cellular and interferon reactions for the kinetics of the uncomplicated {IAV} infection are studied. The contribution of parameters of virusâ€”sensitive tissue, interferon and {IAV-specific} immune processes to the variations of duration and severity of the infection is quantitatively estimated by sensitivity studies. It is shown that the variations in the parameters of a virus-epithelial cell system are more influential on the severity of the infection rather than that of the antiviral immune response. The need for fine co-ordination of the kinetics of the non-specific interferon response and the adaptive antigen-specific immune reactions to provide recovery from the infection is illustrated.},

  abstract  = {Influenza virus kinetics ({VK)} is used as a surrogate of infectiousness, while the natural history of influenza is described by symptom dynamics ({SD).} We used an original virus kinetics/symptom dynamics ({VKSD)} model to characterize human influenza virus infection and illness, based on a population approach. We combined structural equations and a statistical model to describe intra- and interindividual variability. The structural equations described influenza based on the target epithelial cells, the virus, the innate host response, and systemic symptoms. The model was fitted to individual {VK} and {SD} data obtained from 44 volunteers experimentally challenged with influenza {A/H1N1} virus. Infection and illness parameters were calculated from best-fitted model estimates. We predicted that the cytokine level and {NK} cell activity would peak at days 2.2 and 4.2 after inoculation, respectively. Infectiousness, measured as the area under the {VK} curve above a viral titer threshold, lasted between 7.0 and 1.3 days and was 15 times lower in participants without systemic symptoms than in those with systemic symptoms (P {\textless} 0.001). The latent period, defined as the time between inoculation and infectiousness, varied from 0.7 to 1.9 days. The incubation period, defined as the time from inoculation to first symptoms, varied from 1.0 to 2.4 days. Our approach extends previous work by including the innate response and providing realistic estimates of infection and illness parameters, taking into account the strong interindividual variability. This approach could help to optimize studies of influenza {VK} and {SD} and to predict the effect of antivirals on infectiousness and symptoms.},

  abstract    = {Antibodies directed against haemagglutinin, measured by the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay are essential to protective immunity against influenza infection. An HI titre of 1:40 is generally accepted to correspond to a 50\% reduction in the risk of contracting influenza in a susceptible population, but limited attempts have been made to further quantify the association between HI titre and protective efficacy.We present a model, using a meta-analytical approach, that estimates the level of clinical protection against influenza at any HI titre level. Source data were derived from a systematic literature review that identified 15 studies, representing a total of 5899 adult subjects and 1304 influenza cases with interval-censored information on HI titre. The parameters of the relationship between HI titre and clinical protection were estimated using Bayesian inference with a consideration of random effects and censorship in the available information.A significant and positive relationship between HI titre and clinical protection against influenza was observed in all tested models. This relationship was found to be similar irrespective of the type of viral strain (A or B) and the vaccination status of the individuals.Although limitations in the data used should not be overlooked, the relationship derived in this analysis provides a means to predict the efficacy of inactivated influenza vaccines when only immunogenicity data are available. This relationship can also be useful for comparing the efficacy of different influenza vaccines based on their immunological profile.},

  abstract  = {The specific {CD8+} T-cell response during acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus ({LCMV)} infection of mice is characterized by a rapid proliferation phase, followed by a rapid death phase and long-term memory. In {BALB/c} mice the immunodominant and subdominant {CD8+} responses are directed against the {NP118} and {GP283} epitopes. These responses differ mainly in the magnitude of the epitope-specific {CD8+} T-cell expansion. Using mathematical models together with a nonlinear parameter estimation procedure, we estimate the parameters describing the rates of change during the three phases and thereby establish the differences between the responses to the two epitopes. We find that {CD8+} cell proliferation begins 1 to 2 days after infection and occurs at an average rate of 3 dayâˆ’1, reaching the maximum population size between days 5 and 6 after immunization. The 10-fold difference in expansion to the {NP118} and {GP283} epitopes can be accounted for in our model by a 3.5-fold difference in the antigen concentration of these epitopes at which T-cell stimulation is half-maximal. As a consequence of this 3.5-fold difference in the epitope concentration needed for T-cell stimulation, the rates of activation and proliferation of T cells specific for the two epitopes differ during the response and in combination can account for the large difference in the magnitude of the response. After the peak, during the death phase, the population declines at a rate of 0.5 dayâˆ’1, i.e., cells have an average life time of 2 days. The model accounts for a memory cell population of 5\$0 of the peak population size by a reversal to memory of 1 to 2\$0 of the activated cells per day during the death phase.},

  abstract   = {We develop various mathematical models of the clinical latency stage of {HIV-1} infection assuming that {HIV-1} infection is limited either by the availability of cells that {HIV} can infect or by a specific anti-{HIV} cellular immune response. The former models we call â€œtarget-cell-limitedâ€�. Comparing the models by phase plane analysis we find that they all belong to the class of predator-prey models. In the target-cell limited models the virus is a predator feeding upon target cell prey, while in the immune-control models the virus is a prey that is controlled by an immune response predator. Because both classes of models are of predator-prey type they behave similarly in most circumstances. We find that both types of model can account for the generic picture of disease progression in which the {CD4} T cell count slowly decreases and the viral load slowly increases. Additionally, we find that both types of models can adequately describe the clinically observed changes in the plasma {HIV-1} {RNA} loads in response to retroviral therapies.},

  abstract  = {The role of the host immune response in determining the severity and duration of an influenza infection is still unclear. In order to identify severity factors and more accurately predict the course of an influenza infection within a human host, an understanding of the impact of host factors on the infection process is required. Despite the lack of sufficiently diverse experimental data describing the time course of the various immune response components, published mathematical models were constructed from limited human or animal data using various strategies and simplifying assumptions. To assess the validity of these models, we assemble previously published experimental data of the dynamics and role of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, antibodies, and interferon and determined qualitative key features of their effect that should be captured by mathematical models. We test these existing models by confronting them with experimental data and find that no single model agrees completely with the variety of influenza viral kinetics responses observed experimentally when various immune response components are suppressed. Our analysis highlights the strong and weak points of each mathematical model and highlights areas where additional experimental data could elucidate specific mechanisms, constrain model design, and complete our understanding of the immune response to influenza.},

Patients and Methods: We reviewed the medical records of 165 children who had a nasal wash culture positive for {PIV} at our institution between 1998 and 2008. Nasal wash samples were assayed for 26 inflammatory mediators using Luminex bead proteomics. Results: A total of 153 patients, ages 2 weeks to 12 years, with single virus infection were included in our final analysis. Fifty-two patients were infected with {PIV1}, 19 with {PIV2}, 74 with {PIV3}, and 8 with {PIV4.} Lower respiratory tract infection ({LRTI)} was diagnosed in 67 (44\%) patients, 21 (14\%) had laryngotracheobronchitis, and 49 (32\%) had an upper respiratory infection other than laryngotracheobronchitis. {LRTI} was diagnosed in 54\% of patients infected with {PIV3}, 35\% of those infected with {PIV1}, 26\% of those with {PIV2}, and 50\% of those with {PIV4.} Compared with uninfected control patients, {PIV-infected} patients had higher nasal wash concentrations of interleukin-6, {CX-chemokine} ligand 8 ({CXCL8} or interleukin-8), {CCL3} (macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta), {CCL4} (macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta), {CXCL9} (monokine induced by interferon gamma), and {CCL5} (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted ({RANTES).} Patients with {LRTI}, moderate or severe illness, and {PIV} 1 or 3 (respirovirus) infection had higher nasal wash concentrations of {CXCL8} when compared with patients with upper respiratory infection, mild illness, or {PIV} 2 and 4 (rubulavirus) infection (P {\textless} 0.05). Conclusions: {PIV} infection causes a spectrum of illnesses associated with the expression and release of several proinflammatory mediators. Of note, elevated concentrations of {CXCL8} in nasal wash samples are associated with more severe forms of {PIV} disease.},

  abstract    = {Influenza A virus subtype H5N1 has been a public health concern for almost 20years due to its potential ability to become transmissible among humans. Phase I and II clinical trials have assessed safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of inactivated influenza A/H5N1 virus vaccines. A shortage of vaccine is likely to occur during the first months of a pandemic. Hence, determining whether to give one dose to more people or two doses to fewer people to best protect the population is essential. We use hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titers as an immune correlate for avian influenza vaccines. Using an established relationship to obtain a theoretical vaccine efficacy from immunogenicity data from thirteen arms of six phase I and phase II clinical trials of inactivated influenza A/H5N1 virus vaccines, we assessed: (1) the proportion of theoretical vaccine efficacy achieved after a single dose (defined as primary response level), and (2) whether theoretical efficacy increases after a second dose, with and without adjuvant. Participants receiving vaccine with AS03 adjuvant had higher primary response levels (range: 0.48-0.57) compared to participants receiving vaccine with MF59 adjuvant (range: 0.32-0.47), with no observed trends in primary response levels by antigen dosage. After the first and second doses, vaccine with AS03 at dosage levels 3.75, 7.5 and 15mcg had the highest estimated theoretical vaccine efficacy: Dose (1) 45\% (95\% CI: 36-57\%), 53\% (95\% CI: 42-63\%) and 55\% (95\% CI: 44-64\%), respectively and Dose (2) 93\% (95\% CI: 89-96\%), 97\% (95\% CI: 95-98\%) and 97\% (95\% CI: 96-100\%), respectively. On average, the estimated theoretical vaccine efficacy of lower dose adjuvanted vaccines (AS03 and MF59) was 17\% higher than that of higher dose unadjuvanted vaccines, suggesting that including an adjuvant is dose-sparing. These data indicate adjuvanted inactivated influenza A/H5N1 virus vaccine produces high theoretical efficacy after two doses to protect individuals against a potential avian influenza pandemic.},

  abstract  = {Both virus-mediated damage to airway tissues and induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-8 ({IL-8)} could contribute to symptom severity during viral respiratory infections in children. To test the hypothesis that {IL-8} contributes to the pathogenesis of respiratory symptoms during naturally acquired respiratory viral infections in children, nasal wash samples collected from infants with acute viral infections (n = 198) or from healthy uninfected infants (n = 31) were analysed for {IL-8.} Nasal wash {IL-8} was positively related to age in uninfected children (rs = 0.36, p \&lt; 0.05). Respiratory syncytial virus ({RSV)} infection caused more severe respiratory symptoms compared to infections with influenza A, parainfluenza viruses, or rhinoviruses. In addition, {RSV}, parainfluenza and rhinovirus infections increased levels of {IL-8} in nasal lavage fluid, and there were some differences in the ability of the viruses to induce {IL-8} production ({RSV\&gt;influenza}, p \&lt; 0.05). Finally, there were significant correlations between nasal wash {IL-8} levels and symptom scores during infections with rhinovirus (rs = 0.56, p \&lt; 0.001) or influenza A (rs = 0.45, p \&lt; 0.05), but not with parainfluenza virus or {RSV.} These findings provide evidence of a close relationship between the generation of {IL-8} and symptoms during acute community-acquired infections with rhinovirus or influenza A. In contrast, for {RSV} and parainfluenza infections, factors in addition to {IL-8} production appear to contribute to the generation of clinical symptoms.;},

  abstract    = {Identification of an immune response to vaccination that reliably predicts protection from clinically significant infection, i.e. an immunological surrogate endpoint, is a primary goal of vaccine research. Using this problem of evaluating an immunological surrogate as an illustration, we describe a hierarchy of three criteria for a valid surrogate endpoint and statistical analysis frameworks for evaluating them. Based on a placebo-controlled vaccine efficacy trial, the first level entails assessing the correlation of an immune response with a study endpoint in the study groups, and the second level entails evaluating an immune response as a surrogate for the study endpoint that can be used for predicting vaccine efficacy for a setting similar to that of the vaccine trial. We show that baseline covariates, innovative study design, and a potential outcomes formulation can be helpful for this assessment. The third level entails validation of a surrogate endpoint via meta-analysis, where the goal is to evaluate how well the immune response can be used to predict vaccine efficacy for new settings (building bridges). A simulated vaccine trial and two example vaccine trials are presented, one supporting that certain anti-influenza antibody levels are an excellent surrogate for influenza illness and another supporting that certain anti-HIV antibody levels are not useful as a surrogate for HIV infection.},

Safety information was collected by use of diary sheets and telephone interviews. Nasal wash and serum specimens were collected for assessment of infectivity and immunogenicity.; Results: The safety profiles of both dosages of {bPIV3} were similar to that of placebo, with the exception of fever with temperature of \&gt;/=38.1 degrees C after dose 2 only, occurring in 34\% of the 1x10(5) {TCID(50)} group, 35\% of the 1x10(6) {TCID(50)} group, and 12\% of the placebo group (P\&lt;.01). No vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported. The cumulative vaccine infectivity (isolation of {bPIV3} and/or {bPIV3} seroconversion) after dose 3 was similar in the 2 vaccine groups (87\% in the 1x10(5) {TCID(50)} group and 77\% in the 1x10(6) {TCID(50)} group) (P=.46). Seroconversion rates after dose 3, assessed by means of hemagglutination inhibition assay, after adjustment for decrease in maternal antibody titers, were 67\% in the 1x10(5) {TCID(50)} group, 57\% in the 1x10(6) {TCID(50)} group, and 12\% in the placebo group (P\&lt;.01). Isolation of {bPIV3} was common after dose 1, dose 2, or dose 3, but only 1 of 51 participants in the vaccine groups had {bPIV3} isolated after dose 4.; Conclusions: Multiple doses of {bPIV3} vaccine were well tolerated and immunogenic in young infants.;},

  abstract  = {We present a simplified dynamical model of immune response to uncomplicated influenza A virus {(IAV)} infection, which focuses on the control of the infection by the innate and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity is represented by interferon-induced resistance to infection of respiratory epithelial cells and by removal of infected cells by effector cells (cytotoxic T-cells and natural killer cells). Adaptive immunity is represented by virus-specific antibodies. Similar in spirit to the recent model of Bocharov and Romanyukha [1994. Mathematical model of antiviral immune response. {III.} Influenza A virus infection. J. Theor. Biol. 167, 323â€“360], the model is constructed as a system of 10 ordinary differential equations with 27 parameters characterizing the rates of various processes contributing to the course of disease. The parameters are derived from published experimental data or estimated so as to reproduce available data about the time course of {IAV} infection in a naÃ¯ve host. We explore the effect of initial viral load on the severity and duration of the disease, construct a phase diagram that sheds insight into the dynamics of the disease, and perform sensitivity analysis on the model parameters to explore which ones influence the most the onset, duration and severity of infection. To account for the variability and speed of adaptation of the adaptive response to a particular virus strain, we introduce a variable that quantifies the antigenic compatibility between the virus and the antibodies currently produced by the organism. We find that for small initial viral load the disease progresses through an asymptomatic course, for intermediate value it takes a typical course with constant duration and severity of infection but variable onset, and for large initial viral load the disease becomes severe. This behavior is robust to a wide range of parameter values. The absence of antibody response leads to recurrence of disease and appearance of a chronic state with nontrivial constant viral load.},

  abstract             = {Antiviral drugs, most notably the neuraminidase inhibitors, are an important component of control strategies aimed to prevent or limit any future influenza pandemic. The potential large-scale use of antiviral drugs brings with it the danger of drug resistance evolution. A number of recent studies have shown that the emergence of drug-resistant influenza could undermine the usefulness of antiviral drugs for the control of an epidemic or pandemic outbreak. While these studies have provided important insights, the inherently stochastic nature of resistance generation and spread, as well as the potential for ongoing evolution of the resistant strain have not been fully addressed. Here, we study a stochastic model of drug resistance emergence and consecutive evolution of the resistant strain in response to antiviral control during an influenza pandemic. We find that taking into consideration the ongoing evolution of the resistant strain does not increase the probability of resistance emergence; however, it increases the total number of infecteds if a resistant outbreak occurs. Our study further shows that taking stochasticity into account leads to results that can differ from deterministic models. Specifically, we find that rapid and strong control cannot only contain a drug sensitive outbreak, it can also prevent a resistant outbreak from occurring. We find that the best control strategy is early intervention heavily based on prophylaxis at a level that leads to outbreak containment. If containment is not possible, mitigation works best at intermediate levels of antiviral control. Finally, we show that the results are not very sensitive to the way resistance generation is modeled.},

  abstract   = {The epidemiology of acute infections is strongly influenced by the immune status of individuals. In-host models can provide quantitative predictions of immune status and can thus offer valuable insights into the factors that influence transmission between individuals and the effectiveness of vaccination protocols with respect to individual immunity. Here we develop an in-host model of measles infection. The model explicitly considers the effects of immune system memory and {CD8} T-cells, which are key to measles clearance. The model is used to determine the effects of waning immunity through vaccination and infection, the effects of booster exposures or vaccines on the level of immunity, and the immune system characteristics that result in measles transmission ( R 0 \&gt; 1 ) even if an individual has no apparent clinical symptoms. We find that the level of immune system {CD8} T-cells at the time of exposure to measles determines whether an individual will experience a measles infection or simply a boost in immunity. We also find that the infected cell dynamics are a good indicator of measles transmission and the degree of symptoms that will be experienced. Our results indicate that the degree of immunity in adults is independent of the source of exposure in early childhood, be it vaccine or natural infection.},

A total of 112 subjects participated in these studies. Both {rB/HPIV3} and {rHPIV3-NB} were highly restricted in replication in adults and seropositive children but readily infected seronegative children, who shed mean peak virus titers of 102.8 vs. 103.7 {pfu/mL}, respectively. Although {rB/HPIV3} was more restricted in replication in seronegative children than {rHPIV3-NB}, it induced significantly higher titers of hemagglutination inhibition ({HAI)} antibodies against {HPIV3.} Taken together, these data suggest that the {rB/HPIV3} vaccine is the preferred candidate for further clinical development.},

  abstract  = {The safety, infectivity, immunogenicity, transmissibility, and phenotypic stability of an intranasal bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 ({BPIV-3)} candidate vaccine was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Of human parainfluenza virus type 3 ({HPIV-3)-seronegative} children, 92\% were infected, and 92\% developed a serum hemagglutination-inhibiting ({HAI)} antibody response to {BPIV-3} and 61\% to {HPIV-3.} Geometric mean {HAI} titers were 1:40 to {BPIV-3} and 1:16 to {HPIV-3.} In studies to evaluate vaccine transmissibility, none of 14 placebo recipients in close contact with 14 vaccinees shed {BPIV-3.} {BPIV-3} isolates from seronegative vaccinees retained the attenuation phenotype when tested in rhesus monkeys. Although it is difficult to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of such a vaccine in an open population of children who frequently become infected with {HPIV-3}, it appears that the live {BPIV-3} vaccine is attenuated, infectious, immunogenic, poorly transmissible, and phenotypically stable and warrants further evaluation as a candidate vaccine in infants and children.},

  abstract  = {The cellular immune response to primary influenza virus infection is complex, involving multiple cell types and anatomical compartments, and is difficult to measure directly. Here we develop a two-compartment model that quantifies the interplay between viral replication and adaptive immunity. The fidelity of the model is demonstrated by accurately confirming the role of {CD4} help for antibody persistence and the consequences of immune depletion experiments. The model predicts that drugs to limit viral infection and/or production must be administered within 2 days of infection, with a benefit of combination therapy when administered early, and cytotoxic {CD8} T cells in the lung are as effective for viral clearance as neutralizing antibodies when present at the time of challenge. The model can be used to investigate explicit biological scenarios and generate experimentally testable hypotheses. For example, when the adaptive response depends on cellular immune cell priming, regulation of antigen presentation has greater influence on the kinetics of viral clearance than the efficiency of virus neutralization or cellular cytotoxicity. These findings suggest that the modulation of antigen presentation or the number of lung resident cytotoxic cells and the combination drug intervention are strategies to combat highly virulent influenza viruses. We further compared alternative model structures, for example, B-cell activation directly by the virus versus that through professional antigen-presenting cells or dendritic cell licensing of {CD8} T cells.},

  abstract             = {Inoculum dose, i.e. the number of pathogens at the beginning of an infection, often affects key aspects of pathogen and immune response dynamics. These in turn determine clinically relevant outcomes, such as morbidity and mortality. Despite the general recognition that inoculum dose is an important component of infection outcomes, we currently do not understand its impact in much detail. This study is intended to start filling this knowledge gap by analyzing inoculum dependent patterns of viral load dynamics in acute infections. Using experimental data for adenovirus and infectious bronchitis virus infections as examples, we demonstrate inoculum dose dependent patterns of virus dynamics. We analyze the data with the help of mathematical models to investigate what mechanisms can reproduce the patterns observed in experimental data. We find that models including components of both the innate and adaptive immune response are needed to reproduce the patterns found in the data. We further analyze which types of innate or adaptive immune response models agree with observed data. One interesting finding is that only models for the adaptive immune response that contain growth terms partially independent of viral load can properly reproduce observed patterns. This agrees with the idea that an antigen-independent, programmed response is part of the adaptive response. Our analysis provides useful insights into the types of model structures that are required to properly reproduce observed virus dynamics for varying inoculum doses. We suggest that such models should be taken as basis for future models of acute viral infections.},

Growth curves revealed that nasal and pulmonary tissues of naive animals were semi-permissive for virus replication, with amounts of progeny virus proportional to inoculating doses. In naive animals there was a total eclipse in nasal tissues beginning 4 h after inoculation. By contrast, there was only partial eclipse of virus in pulmonary tissues, most pronounced at 1 h after inoculation. Immune animals demonstrated a delayed eclipse in pulmonary tissues upon rechallenge. Infection with very low doses of {HPIV-3} induced complete protection against high-dose challenge in the absence of systemic neutralizing antibody, suggesting a significant role for other systemic or local immune effectors.},

  abstract  = {Influenza virus infection remains a public health problem worldwide. The mechanisms underlying viral control during an uncomplicated influenza virus infection are not fully understood. Here, we developed a mathematical model including both innate and adaptive immune responses to study the within-host dynamics of equine influenza virus infection in horses. By comparing modeling predictions with both interferon and viral kinetic data, we examined the relative roles of target cell availability, and innate and adaptive immune responses in controlling the virus. Our results show that the rapid and substantial viral decline (about 2 to 4 logs within 1 day) after the peak can be explained by the killing of infected cells mediated by interferon activated cells, such as natural killer cells, during the innate immune response. After the viral load declines to a lower level, the loss of interferon-induced antiviral effect and an increased availability of target cells due to loss of the antiviral state can explain the observed short phase of viral plateau in which the viral level remains unchanged or even experiences a minor second peak in some animals. An adaptive immune response is needed in our model to explain the eventual viral clearance. This study provides a quantitative understanding of the biological factors that can explain the viral and interferon kinetics during a typical influenza virus infection. {INSET:} Author Summary.

Ideally efficacy correlates with some measurement of immune response, although occasionally the correlation is weak and in the case of some vaccines uncertain. This paper attempts to review what is known about correlates of vaccine-induced protection. Although mucosal and cellular immune responses are clearly important to protection by some vaccines, most vaccines licensed today depend for their efficacy on serum antibodies. Particular levels of antibodies can be identified that confer protection most of the time. A condition for the efficacy of antibodies is functionality, i.e. their ability to kill or inactivate pathogens. The immune system is redundant, and the different types of responses to vaccines act synergistically.},

Correlates of protection after vaccination are sometimes absolute quantities but often are relative, such that most infections are prevented at a particular level of response but some will occur above that level because of a large challenge dose or deficient host factors. There may be >1 correlate of protection for a disease, which we term "cocorrelates." Either effector or central memory may correlate with protection. Cell-mediated immunity also may operate as a correlate or cocorrelate of protection against disease, rather than against infection. In situations where the true correlate of protection is unknown or difficult to measure, surrogate tests (usually antibody measurements) must suffice as predictors of protection by vaccines.

We suggest a general framework for assessing these 3 levels of immune correlates in vaccine efficacy trials. To demonstrate the proposed principles, we analyze data from a 1943 influenza vaccine field trial, supporting Weiss strain A-specific antibody titers as a level 1 surrogate of protection.

All subjects immunized with 100 μg of the NV-VLP vaccine and 90\% of those who received 50 μg had significant IgA or IgG B(M) responses. The B(M) cell frequencies correlated with serum antibody levels and mucosally-primed antibody-secreting cell responses.

  abstract  = {Over a 20-year period in a population of otherwise healthy children, respiratory viruses have been cultured from nasal wash specimens from each child with a clinically significant respiratory illness. Since efforts are underway to develop vaccines for prevention of illness due to parainfluenza virus ({PIV)} type 3, the epidemiologic characteristics of {PIVs} were reviewed, and the population size necessary to demonstrate vaccine efficacy was estimated. A population of 1429 children was followed through early childhood. {PIVs} were isolated from 286 samples, 17.4\% of positive viral cultures. {PIV-3} was the most common: 10\% of the children had at least one symptomatic, culture-proven {PIV-3} infection. {PIV-3} was endemic during the study period, while the other two {PIVs}, {PIV-1} and -2, caused biennial flu epidemics. Only four {PIV-related} hospitalizations were seen. The efficacy of a {PIV-3} vaccine could be demonstrated in a trial of 600 carefully monitored children vaccinated by 3 months and followed to 15 months of age.},

  abstract  = {A key question in pandemic influenza is the relative roles of innate immunity and target cell depletion in limiting primary infection and modulating pathology. Here, we model these interactions using detailed data from equine influenza virus infection, combining viral and immune (type I interferon) kinetics with estimates of cell depletion. The resulting dynamics indicate a powerful role for innate immunity in controlling the rapid peak in virus shedding. As a corollary, cells are much less depleted than suggested by a model of human influenza based only on virus-shedding data. We then explore how differences in the influence of viral proteins on interferon kinetics can account for the observed spectrum of virus shedding, immune response, and influenza pathology. In particular, induction of high levels of interferon (â€œcytokine stormsâ€�), coupled with evasion of its effects, could lead to severe pathology, as hypothesized for some fatal cases of influenza.},

  abstract  = {Parainfluenza viruses ({PIV)} have been generally disregarded as pathogens in spite of their importance in pediatric lower respiratory illness. Because {PIVs} account for 17\% of hospitalized illness associated virus isolation, the development of {PIV} vaccine would be a major advance in preventing lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children. We will review in detail several {PIV} vaccine candidates and recent newer approaches to {PIV} vaccine development. Intranasally administered bovine {PIV3} ({bPIV3)} vaccine and cold-adapted {PIV3} vaccine have been evaluated throughout the pediatric age spectrum. {BPIV3} does not give a robust response to the heterotypic human strain although seroconversion rate to {bPIV3} is 57-65\%. However, {bPIV3} vaccine is being used as an attenuated backbone for insertion of human {PIV3} hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and fusion (F) proteins and a surface protein, F, of respiratory syncytial virus. The effectiveness of this vaccine against both {PIV3} and {RSV} challenge has been demonstrated in African green monkeys. The cold-adapted {PIV3} vaccine has been extensively evaluated and is safe and immunogenic in seronegative children with a seroconversion rate of 79\%. These promising candidates deserve to enter into efficacy trials both for their ability to prevent {PIV3} disease and as a model of protection against respiratory illness by mucosal vaccination., (C) 2008 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins, Inc.},

The T cell chemoattractants {CXCL10} and {CXCL11} were the most abundant chemokines induced.

  abstract   = {Influenza A virus is an important respiratory pathogen that poses a considerable threat to public health each year during seasonal epidemics and even more so when a pandemic strain emerges. Understanding the mechanisms involved in controlling an influenza infection within a host is important and could result in new and effective treatment strategies. Kinetic models of influenza viral growth and decay can summarize data and evaluate the biological parameters governing interactions between the virus and the host. Here we discuss recent viral kinetic models for influenza. We show how these models have been used to provide insight into influenza pathogenesis and treatment, and we highlight the challenges of viral kinetic analysis, including accurate model formulation, estimation of important parameters, and the collection of detailed data sets that measure multiple variables simultaneously. {WIREs} Syst Biol Med 2011 3 429â€“445 {DOI:} 10.1002/wsbm.129},

The vaccine contained a GI.1 VLP (Norwalk) and a consensus GII.4 VLP, representing the two major genotypes that cause human disease, and was administered on days 0 and 28 to healthy adults aged 18-49 years. Four separate cohorts received increasing doses of 5 μg, 15 μg, 50 μg, and 150 μg of each VLP adjuvanted in monophosphoryl lipid A and alum. PBMCs were analyzed for B cell activation and mucosal homing markers (flow cytometry) and VLP-specific and total IgG and IgA Ab-secreting cells (ASCs); and serum titers of VLP-specific IgG, IgA, and Pan-Ig were determined.The vaccine elicited CD27+ CD38+ plasmablasts and high frequencies of ASCs specific for both VLP antigens in the peripheral blood at 7 days after the first dose. The plasmablasts exhibited a mucosal-homing phenotype and included a high proportion of IgA ASCs. Serum antibodies increased as early as 7 days after the first immunization.The data suggest that a single dose of the IM bivalent norovirus vaccine is effective in activating pre-existing B cell memory. The rapid B cell response and the mucosal homing phenotype of induced ASCs are consistent with anamnestic responses in subjects primed by prior oral norovirus infection.

Doses (5 µg, 15 µg, 50 µg, or 150 µg of each VLP) were administered 4 weeks apart in the first stage. Subsequently, 54 adults, aged 18-49 (n=16), 50-64 (n=19), and 65-85 (n=19) years, received 2 doses of vaccine containing 50 µg of each VLP. Total and class-specific antibody responses, as well as histoblood group antigen (HBGA) blocking antibody responses, were measured before and after each dose.Local reactions were mainly injection site pain/tenderness, with no reported fever or vaccine-related serious adverse events. One dose of vaccine containing 50 µg of each VLP increased GI.1 geometric mean titers (GMTs) by 118-fold, 83-fold, and 24-fold and increased GII.4 GMTs by 49-fold, 25-fold, and 9-fold in subjects aged 18-49, 50-64, and 65-83 years, respectively. Serum antibody responses peaked at day 7 after the first dose, with no evidence of boosting following a second dose. Most subjects achieved HBGA-blocking antibody titers of ≥200.The vaccine was well tolerated and immunogenic. Rapid immune response to a single dose may be particularly useful in military personnel and travelers and in the control of outbreaks. Clinical Trials Registration. NCT01168401.},

  abstract    = {Case reports describe significant norovirus gastroenteritis morbidity in immunocompromised patients. We evaluated norovirus pathogenesis in prospectively enrolled solid organ (SOT) and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients with diarrhea who presented to Texas Children's Hospital and submitted stool for enteric testing. Noroviruses were detected by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Clinical outcomes of norovirus diarrhea and non-norovirus diarrhea patients, matched by transplanted organ type, were compared. Norovirus infection was identified in 25 (22\%) of 116 patients, more frequently than other enteropathogens. Fifty percent of norovirus patients experienced diarrhea lasting ≥14 days, with median duration of 12.5 days (range 1-324 days); 29\% developed diarrhea recurrence. Fifty-five percent of norovirus patients were hospitalized for diarrhea, with 27\% requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. One HSCT recipient developed pneumatosis intestinalis. Three HSCT patients expired ≤6 months of norovirus diarrhea onset. Compared to non-norovirus diarrhea patients, norovirus patients experienced significantly more frequent ICU admission (27\% vs. 0\%, p = 0.02), greater serum creatinine rise (median 0.3 vs. 0.2 mg/dL, p = 0.01), and more weight loss (median 1.6 vs. 0.6 kg, p < 0.01). Noroviruses are an important cause of diarrhea in pediatric transplant patients and are associated with significant clinical complications.},

  abstract    = {After Hurricane Katrina, an estimated 200,000 persons were evacuated to the Houston metropolitan area, >27,000 of whom were housed in 1 large "megashelter," the Reliant Park Complex. We investigated an outbreak of gastroenteritis reported among the evacuees who resided in the Reliant Park Complex to assess the spread of the infectious agent, norovirus, and to implement and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions used for control.Public health authorities conducted surveillance of gastroenteritis among evacuees treated at the Reliant Park Medical Clinic during 2-12 September 2005. Basic demographic and clinical data were recorded. Specimens of stool and vomitus were collected and tested for bacteria, parasites, and viruses. Shelter census data were used to estimate the daily incidence of disease.During a period of 11 days, >1000 patients were treated at the clinic for gastroenteritis, which accounted for 17\% of all clinic visits. Norovirus was the sole enteric pathogen identified, but multiple different strains were involved. Among the evacuees residing in the Reliant Park Complex, the incidence of gastroenteritis was estimated to be 4.6 visits per 1000 persons per day, and among the evacuees who resided there for 9 days, 1 (4\%) of 24 persons would have been ill. Intensive public health measures were promptly instituted but did not definitively slow the progression of the outbreak of norovirus gastroenteritis.Our investigation underscores the difficulties in managing such outbreaks in crowded settings and the need for rapid, sensitive laboratory assays to detect norovirus. Additional research is needed to establish more effective measures to control and prevent this highly contagious gastrointestinal illness.},

Norwalk virus spiked in groundwater remained infectious after storage at room temperature in the dark for 61 days (the last time point tested). The Norwalk virus-seeded groundwater was stored for 1,266 days and analyzed, after RNase treatment, by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) to detect Norwalk virus RNA contained within intact capsids. Norwalk virus RNA within intact capsids was detected in groundwater for 1,266 days, with no significant log(10) reduction throughout 427 days and a significant 1.10-log(10) reduction by day 1266. Purified Norwalk virus RNA (extracted from Norwalk virus virions) persisted for 14 days in groundwater, tap water, and reagent-grade water. This study demonstrates that Norwalk virus in groundwater can remain detectable for over 3 years and can remain infectious for at least 61 days. (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00313404.).},

  abstract        = {Contamination of oysters with human noroviruses (HuNoV) constitutes a human health risk and may lead to severe economic losses in the shellfish industry. There is a need to identify a technology that can inactivate HuNoV in oysters. In this study, we conducted a randomized, double-blinded clinical trial to assess the effect of high hydrostatic pressure processing (HPP) on Norwalk virus (HuNoV genogroup I.1) inactivation in virus-seeded oysters ingested by subjects. Forty-four healthy, positive-secretor adults were divided into three study phases. Subjects in each phase were randomized into control and intervention groups. Subjects received Norwalk virus (8FIIb, 1.0 × 10(4) genomic equivalent copies) in artificially seeded oysters with or without HPP treatment (400 MPa at 25°C, 600 MPa at 6°C, or 400 MPa at 6°C for 5 min). HPP at 600 MPa, but not 400 MPa (at 6° or 25°C), completely inactivated HuNoV in seeded oysters and resulted in no HuNoV infection among these subjects, as determined by reverse transcription-PCR detection of HuNoV RNA in subjects' stool or vomitus samples. Interestingly, a white blood cell (granulocyte) shift was identified in 92% of the infected subjects and was significantly associated with infection (P = 0.0014). In summary, these data suggest that HPP is effective at inactivating HuNoV in contaminated whole oysters and suggest a potential intervention to inactivate infectious HuNoV in oysters for the commercial shellfish industry.},

  abstract        = {Norovirus immunity is poorly understood as the limited data available on protection after infection are often contradictory. In contrast to the more prominent GII noroviruses, GI norovirus infections are less frequent in outbreaks. The GI noroviruses display very complex patterns of heterotypic immune responses following infection, and many individuals are highly susceptible to reinfection. To study the immune responses and mechanisms of GI.1 persistence, we built structural models and recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs) of five GI strains: GI.1-1968, GI.1-2001, GI.2-1999, GI.3-1999, and GI.4-2000. Structural models of four GI genotype capsid P domain dimers suggested that intragenotype structural variation is limited, that the GI binding pocket is mostly preserved between genotypes, and that a conserved, surface-exposed epitope may allow for highly cross-reactive immune responses. GI VLPs bound to histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) including fucose, Lewis, and A antigens. Volunteers infected with GI.1-1968 (n = 10) had significant increases between prechallenge and convalescent reactive IgG for all five GI VLPs measured by enzyme immunoassay. Potential cross-neutralization of GI VLPs was demonstrated by convalescent-phase serum cross-blockade of GI VLP-HBGA interaction. Although group responses were significant for all GI VLPs, each individual volunteer demonstrated a unique VLP blockade pattern. Further, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated with each of the VLPs, and secretion of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) was measured. As seen with blockade responses, IFN-gamma secretion responses differed by individual. Sixty percent responded to at least one GI VLP, with only two volunteers responding to GI.1 VLP. Importantly, four of five individuals with sufficient PBMCs for cross-reactivity studies responded more robustly to other GI VLPs. These data suggest that preexposure history and deceptive imprinting may complicate PBMC and B-cell immune responses in some GI.1-1968-challenged individuals and highlight a potential complication in the design of efficacious norovirus vaccines.},

  abstract        = {Noroviruses (NoV) are the most common cause of epidemic gastroenteritis world-wide. NoV infections are often asymptomatic, although individuals still shed large amounts of NoV in their stool. Understanding the differences between asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals would help in elucidating mechanisms of NoV pathogenesis. Our goal was to compare the serum cytokine responses and faecal viral RNA titres of asymptomatic and symptomatic NoV-infected individuals. We tested serum samples from infected subjects (n = 26; 19 symptomatic, seven asymptomatic) from two human challenge studies of GI.1 NoV for 16 cytokines. Samples from prechallenge and days 1-4 post-challenge were tested for these cytokines. Cytokine levels were compared to stool NoV RNA titres quantified previously by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). While both symptomatic and asymptomatic groups had similar patterns of cytokine responses, the symptomatic group generally exhibited a greater elevation of T helper type 1 (Th1) and Th2 cytokines and IL-8 post-challenge compared to the asymptomatic group (all P < 0·01). Daily viral RNA titre was associated positively with daily IL-6 concentration and negatively with daily IL-12p40 concentration (all P < 0·05). Symptoms were not associated significantly with daily viral RNA titre, duration of viral shedding or cumulative shedding. Symptomatic individuals, compared to asymptomatic, have greater immune system activation, as measured by serum cytokines, but they do not have greater viral burden, as measured by titre and shedding, suggesting that symptoms may be immune-mediated in NoV infection.},

  abstract        = {Noroviruses (NoV) are the most common cause of epidemic gastroenteritis worldwide. The acute immune response to NoV in humans is poorly understood, hindering research on prevention and treatment. To elucidate the acute immune response and test for cytokine predictors of susceptibility to infection, serum samples from two human NoV challenge studies were tested for 16 cytokines. Subjects who became infected (n = 26) were age-matched with subjects who remained uninfected following NoV challenge (n = 26). Samples were tested from prechallenge and days 1-4 post-challenge. Cytokine responses were compared between infected and uninfected groups. Overall, infected individuals exhibited an elevation in T helper type 1 (Th1) and Th2 cytokines, as well as chemokines interleukin (IL)-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1), compared to uninfected individuals (all P < 0.05). Most cytokines peaked on day 2 post-challenge in infected subjects, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-8, and IL-10 remained elevated to day 3. The only cytokine elevated significantly among infected subjects to day 4 post-challenge was IL-10 (P = 0.021). Prechallenge cytokine concentrations were not predictive of infection status post-challenge. There were no significant changes in serum cytokines among NoV-challenged subjects who remained uninfected. These results suggest that NoV infection elicits a Th1-type response, with some Th2 activation. Persistent elevation of IL-10 among infected subjects is consistent with activation of adaptive immune responses, such as B cell expansion, as well as down-regulation of Th1 cytokines. This study presents the first comprehensive description of the acute cytokine response to GI.1 NoV in humans.},

  abstract     = {Policy recommendations on contact investigation of HIV-seropositive patients with tuberculosis have changed several times. Current epidemiologic evidence informing these recommendations is considered low quality, and few large studies investigating the infectiousness of HIV-seropositive and -seronegative index cases have been performed in sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed the infectiousness of HIV-seropositive and -seronegative patients with tuberculosis to their household contacts and examined potential modifiers of this relationship. Adults suffering from their first episode of pulmonary tuberculosis were identified in Kampala, Uganda. Field workers visited index households and enrolled consenting household contacts. Latent tuberculosis infection was measured through tuberculin skin testing, and relative risks were calculated using modified Poisson regression models. Standard assessments of interaction between latent tuberculosis infection, the HIV serostatus of index cases, and other variables were performed. Latent tuberculosis infection was found in 577 of 878 (65.7%) and 717 of 974 (73.6%) household contacts of HIV-seropositive and -seronegative tuberculosis cases (relative risk, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.82-0.97). On further stratification, cavitary lung disease (P < 0.0001 for interaction) and smear status (P = 0.02 for interaction) of tuberculosis cases modified the infectiousness of HIV-seropositive indexes. Cough duration of index cases did not display interaction (P = 0.499 for interaction). This study suggests that HIV-seropositive tuberculosis cases may be less infectious than HIV-seronegative patients only when they are smear-negative or lack cavitary lung disease. These results may explain heterogeneity between prior studies and provide evidence suggesting that tuberculosis contact investigation should include HIV-seropositive index cases in high disease burden settings.},

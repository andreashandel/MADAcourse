# Overview
For this exercise, we will do another TidyTuesday project. This time, you are asked to include some statistical analyses into your project.


# TidyTuesday 2 Workflow

Follow the workflow of the previous TidyTuesday exercise (see there for details). As a quick reminder:

* [Get this week's TidyTuesday data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). 

* Create a new Github repository inside the class organization and call it `YOURNAME-tidytuesday2`. The repository should be viewable as webpage later, so you need to turn on Github pages. See the directions from the `Introducing ourselves` project if you forgot how to do that.

* Once you finished your project, post the link to the html site with your report/write-up to the Tidytuesday 2 discussion board. If you are active on social media, you can post an announcement of your project there. 

* For any help requests, post your questions to the discussion board for this project. 


# TidyTuesday 2 Specific Instructions

* After learning what the dataset is, think of one or a few questions you might want to answer. That means, decide what your outcome(s) of interest is/are, and what (if any) your main predictor of interest. Based on that, decide on what kinds of models you might want to use for analysis.

* Do enough wrangling/cleaning/processing to get your data into a shape that you can use for your analysis. You can be briefer here than in the previous TidyTuesday exercise, but of course you have to get the data ready for modeling.

* Fit at least 2 different suitable models to your data. Report model performance, model diagnostics and overall findings. Discuss what it means, both for the models you used and for the overall question you asked.

* The focus of this exercise should be on the modeling part, so I expect that to take up more then 50% of your code/report/overall analysis. Once done, write it all up and post as described above.

This folder and subfolders are part of a template project setup containing files and folder structures for a data analysis project/paper done with R/Quarto/Github. 

The full template can be found [here](https://github.com/ahgroup/dataanalysis-template).

Note that is is generally not a good idea to have something like an analysis project inside a bigger "thing", such as a portfolio website. We are doing this here for simplicity. But in general, it would make more sense for this folder and subfolders to be its own R Project and repository.

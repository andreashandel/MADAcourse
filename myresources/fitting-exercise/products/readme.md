The folders inside this folder should contain all the products of your project.

For a classical academic project, this will be a peer-reviewed manuscript, and should be placed into a `manuscript` folder. 

For our case, since we'll want to put it on the website, we call it a report. 


Often you need a library of references in bibtex format, as well as a CSL style file that determines reference formatting. Since those files might be used by several of the products, I'm placing them in the main products folder. Feel free to re-organize.

This folder contains a simple made-up data-set in an Excel file.

It contains the variables `Height`, `Weight` and `Gender` of a few imaginary individuals.

The dataset purposefully contains some faulty entries that need to be cleaned.

Generally, any dataset should contain some meta-data explaining what each variable in the dataset is. (This is often called a **Codebook**.) For this simple example, the codebook is given as a second sheet in the Excel file.

This raw data-set should generally not be edited by hand. It should instead be loaded and processed/cleaned using code.

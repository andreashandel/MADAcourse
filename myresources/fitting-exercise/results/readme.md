This folder contains results produced by the code, such as figures and tables.

Depending on the size and type of your project, you can either place it all in a single folder or create sub-folders. For instance you could create a folder for figures, another for tables. Or you could create a sub-folder for dataset 1, another for dataset 2. Or you could have a subfolder for exploratory analysis, another for final analysis. The options are endless, choose whatever makes sense for your project. For this template, there is just a a single folder, but having sub-folders is often a good idea.

This folder contains code for processing data.

Currently, there is just a single Quarto file to illustrate how the processing can look like.

Instead of a Quarto file that contains code, it is also possible to use R scripts or a combination of R scripts and Quarto code. Those approaches are illustrated in the full dataanalysis-template repository.

# Module Assessments

Make sure you've gone through all the content for this module.

## Quiz

Do the quiz for this module on eLC. The quiz consists of around 5-10 fairly easy questions. It is timed, so you need to have gone through the material and either remember some of the main items or at least remember where you saw it so you can look it up quickly.


## Exercise

While the exercise for this module does not directly deal with data analysis workflow and structure, it introduces you to some more Github functionality, a tool that you have probably figured out by now is a great component of any good a reproducible project. Specifically, we will be looking at the concept of _Issues_. The exercise is called [Github Issues](./Exercise_Github_Issues.html).

**Note that part of this exercise is due by Wednesday evening.**


# Discussion

Look online and find an example of a research project that provides (or claims to provide) all materials to allow reproduction of results, similar to Brian's project I shared with you. If you are able, download the materials and see if you can reproduce things. Report the project you found and your experience reproducing it in the _Reproducible Project Examples_ channel. I suggest you focus on projects that are done with our set of tools (R/Rmarkdown, etc.). Post your finding.

As I was looking for examples for this course, I found it surprisingly difficult to find research projects that were _fully and fairly easily_ reproducible. I didn't find a single one "out there" that seemed both complete and easy enough to point to it. Often the projects only provided data or code to reproduce some parts, and usually, the setup and effort required were significant. I'm curious to see if you can find some projects that are easy to reproduce and that provide the required information to reproduce the majority of results.

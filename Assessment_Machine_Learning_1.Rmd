# Quiz

Get the quiz sheet for this module from the general [__Assessments__](./Course_Assessments.html) page. Fill it in, then submit to the online grading system before the deadline. 



# Exercise

For this exercise, we will implement some of the machine learning models covered in this module, and some of the general approaches we covered previously. We'll basically try to do a full analysis. So let's get started!



# Setup

We'll resume work on the data set and exercise concerning the influenza data from Brian's paper. We'll also do group work again, so team up as previously. Either pairs (with someone you haven't worked with in a while) or for a group of 3, the circular setup. 

Make sure your repo for this exercise is fully synced. We'll do the group work a bit different, you **start with your partner's repo.** If you are a collaborator on their repo, make sure you pulled the latest to your local machine. If you work on a fork, make sure you update your fork to the latest, then pull to your local machine.

Once you have your partner's latest version of the exercise repo, open the RStudio project for the exercise. 



# Pre-processing code

We previously covered pre-processing, but haven't really done any of that yet. 



# Analysis code

So far, we have code that uses the `tidymodels` framework to fit linear and logistic regression models with different number of predictor variables to either a categorical outcome (classification) or a continuous outcome (regression). For this exercise, we'll implement a few additional machine learning models, use cross-validation, and compare results from multiple models.

I suggest you start with a new R script or Rmd file for this. You might want to and can copy certain parts of the code over from the previous analysis script. 




**Finish this part by Wednesday, push your changes and let your partner know that things are ready for them to take over.**



# Presenting your findings

In the final step for this set of exercises/projects, we want to nicely present all the important parts of the analyses in a manuscript type format. To that end, pull the latest version of **your** repository for this exercise to your local computer. Open the project in Rstudio.




# Discussion

Find a peer-reviewed paper where the authors use one or several of the approaches covered this week, and discuss if the authors properly explain and justify why they are doing what they are doing, and why you think what they are doing is or is not a good approach given their stated objective(s).

Post your discussion (with link to paper) by Wednesday, then read at least one other paper posted by your classmates and comment on it.

# Introducing myself

This is the introduction page for Andreas Handel.

## A picture
Here is a picture of me pursuing one of my favorite activities. 

```{r andreas,  out.width = "30%", fig.cap='', fig.align = "center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./andreas.jpg")
```

This is a Muffaletta Sandwich from [Cochon Butcher](https://cochonbutcher.com/) in New Orleans. 

## More about me
Now I am going to cheat a little bit and mostly link to existing material that introduces me. Those sources above will tell you about my education, training, research and some hobbies. 

You can read a bit more about my work and my training on my [group website](http://handelgroup.uga.edu/) and specifically [my entry](http://handelgroup.uga.edu/authors/andreashandel/).

As part of making this course, UGA's office of online learning made a general introductory video for me.

## A cool data analysis link

There are a lot of cool data analysis projects out there by now. Here is one from 538, which gives a nice [interactive illustration of the phenomenon of _p-hacking_](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/p-hacking/), which basically means investigators playing with data until they get something _statistically significant_ - a problem [that is very widespread in science](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002106). We'll likely touch on that topic at some point in the course.

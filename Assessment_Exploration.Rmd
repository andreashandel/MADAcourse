# Quiz

Get the quiz sheet for this module from the general [__Assessments__](./Course_Assessments.html) page. Fill it in, then submit to the online grading system before the deadline. 


# Exercise

## Overview

For this exercise, we will join the R data science community and participate **Tidy Tuesday**, a weekly exercise that allows you to practice some parts of data analysis. The focus for Tidy Tuesday is on getting, cleaning (i.e., tidying) and exploring a data set, though people sometimes do statistical analyses as well. 


## What is Tidy Tuesday 

You briefly encountered Tidy Tuesday before in the [Data Analysis Motivation unit](./Data_Analysis_Motivation.html). If you can't remember, revisit that unit and re-read that section. Also read the information at the provided links. 

If you want to see another Tidy Tuesday example, [here is one I did](https://www.andreashandel.com/posts/tidytuesday-analysis/), as part of a previous version of MADA. I did it at the same time the students did theirs. I plan to do my own Tidy Tuesday again this time. For even more examples of previous analyses, [see this nice Shiny app](https://nsgrantham.shinyapps.io/tidytuesdayrocks/) which scans twitter for posts mentioning `#tidytuesday`. 


:::note
Apparently, there is now also a [Tidy Tuesday podcast](https://www.tidytuesday.com/). I'm not familiar with it, so I'm not sure what it's all about and if it is worth checking out. It probably is worth giving it a try, since it's (almost) always good to check out new things `r emo::ji('grin')` and those are very short recordings, so I think they just introduce the data of the week. If you end up listening to some, let me know what you think (post somewhere on Slack).

## Your Tidy Tuesday Exercise

Your assignment is to participate in Tidy Tuesday by analyzing this week's dataset. You can start as soon as the dataset is posted, which is Mondays. [The datasets are released on GitHub](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). As I'm writing this, I have no idea what the data will be the week this exercise happens. That's part of the fun of it `r emo::ji('smile')`.

Here are some more detailed instructions:

* Use your portfolio website. Make sure it's up to date and fully synced. Open it in R Studio. Then open the

* Create a new Github repository inside the class organization and call it `YOURNAME-tidytuesday1`. The repository should be viewable as webpage later, so you need to turn on Github pages. See the directions from the `Introducing ourselves` project if you forgot how to do that.

* Go to the [TidyTuesday Github repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). Look for the dataset for this week, read the instructions on how to get the data. You will also be provided with a data dictionary. 

* Write an R Markdown file that loads the data, performs any needed cleaning and wrangling, and produces some results (tables, figures). For this exercise, you don't need to implement any statistical models (we'll do another TidyTuesday exercise later, for which you'll be asked to implement some statistical model). 

* Once done, knit your Rmd file into an html file. By/before the deadline, post your project to your github repository. Your file should display as a website, exactly like we did for the _Introducing ourselves_ project. 

* Post the link to your project (both the html/website and the Rmd file) in the Tidytuesday 1 discussion board. If you are active on social media, you can post an announcement of your project there. 

* For any help requests, post your questions to the discussion board for this project. 

## Setup

For this week's exercise, we will participate in the [Tidy Tuesday]() community project.





# Discussion

Write a post in this week's discussion channel that answers this question:

_What is (so far) your favorite R package or command or plot type or... for data cleaning or exploration? What data cleaning or exploration operation do you find tricky to do and wish you knew a better way of tackling that (with R)?_

Then comment on each others posts. Especially if someone is looking for better ways of doing certain cleaning/exploration operations in R, if you know of a good way, tell them.

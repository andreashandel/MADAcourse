# ChatGPT prompt to write first draft of code
# Note that this prompt was far from what I wanted, so 
# there were several iterations where I asked it to update the code
##############################################################
# write R code that generates a longitudinal and hierarchical dataset.
# The dataset should show drug concentrations, levels of cholesterol 
# and adverse events for patients over time.
# Patients should be in two treatment groups, receiving different doses of the drug on day 0.
# Each patient should have 10 samples taken over the course of 10 days.
# Add a lot of comments to your code to explain what you are doing.
# Assume that adverse events depend on drug concentration.

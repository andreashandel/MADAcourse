This is the current course schedule for the class. Things might change, so check regularly for updates.


The _Assessments_ column lists items that need to be submitted and that will be graded. Those are described in more detail in an [__Assessments__](./Course_Assessments.html) page and in the assessment document for each module. 

__Unless otherwise specified, the first posting of the discussion is due by end of Wednesday, the discussion replies, the quizzes and exercises are due by end of Friday.__

## Synchronous Zoom meetings

I will offer **completely optional** Zoom meetings. See the _Communication_ section for some more details. You can find the Zoom link on Slack. The current plan is to have **one Zoom meeting per module on Thursdays, alternating between 3pm (odd modules) and 8am (even modules).** (That means, most of the time, one meeting per week, unless a module is longer than a week, as it is for the first one.)

Hopefully, one of those two times works for everyone, allowing people to join at least every other time if they want. If you already know that neither times work for you, and you are keen on joining the Zoom meetings, let me know and we can adjust.

**The first Zoom session will be on Thursday, 8/19 at 3pm ET.**

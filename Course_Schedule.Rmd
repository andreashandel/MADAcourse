## Synchronous Zoom meetings

I will offer a weekly, **completely optional** Zoom meeting (aka office hour). See the *Communication* section for some more details. You can find the Zoom link on Slack. The plan is to have weekly alternating times for those zoom meetings such that everyone is able to make the meeting at least every 2 weeks.

The current plan is to have **Zoom meetings for odd module numbers on Tuesdays at 8am, and for even module numbers on Wednesdays at 8am.**

Hopefully, at least one of those two times works for everyone, allowing people to join at least every other time if they want. If you already know that neither times work for you, and you are keen on joining the Zoom meetings, let me know and we can adjust.

**The first Zoom session will be on Tuesday, 1/10 at 8am ET.**

# Module Assessments

Make sure you've gone through all the content for this module.

## Quiz

Do the quiz for this module on eLC. The quiz consists of around 5-10 fairly easy questions. It is timed, so you need to have gone through the material and either remember some of the main items or at least remember where you saw it so you can look it up quickly.


## Exercise

For this module, you are asked to do a project for which you'll be using Github, R, RStudio, and Rmarkdown to post a short personal introduction of yourself. A detailed description and instructions are provided as [Introducing Ourselves](./Exercise_Introducing_Ourselves.html) in the _Exercises_ section.

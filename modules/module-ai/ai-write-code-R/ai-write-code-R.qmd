# Goals
By the end of the unit, you should:


# Introduction



# Summary

To sum up, important reasons to use synthetic data are:

- Full knowledge of the truth, which can be used for model testing
- No problems with confidentiality
- Potentially easier to manipulate

Ways to generate synthetic data are:

- Completely made up
- Following distributions obtained from the original data
- Scrambling of the original data
- A mix of these approaches



# Further Resources

In the next units, we will discuss how to actually generate synthetic data and how to use it.

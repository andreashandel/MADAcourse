# Overview
In this unit, we discuss using LLM AI tools to help write code.


# Learning Objectives

* Know how and why to use current LLM AI tools to help with coding.
* Be familiar with several approaches of LLM AI assisted coding.


# Introduction

If you write code, there are (at least) two major parts to the effort. First, you have to figure out what exactly you want to accomplish with your code. Second, you need to write a bunch of commands in some programming language of your choice to get what you are hoping to accomplish. 
The first part is generally the intellectually more challenging one, and a step which AI (currently) are not very good at. The second part is generally less hard, but it can be very tedious, especially if you are new to coding or if you need to write a lot of code. AI are getting pretty good at helping with writing code.

I expect that soon, instead of people writing code, most code will be written by AI under the guidance and direction of people. This should eventually lead to much more efficient, and potentially also better code. We aren't quite there yet, but the current AI tools are already quite useful for helping with code tasks, so you should use them.

# Good prompting

To get good results from the AI, it is important that you be as specific as you can with your prompt.

Try this prompt with one of the LLM AI:

::: prompt
Write R code that generates a scatterplot and a violin plot.
:::

Your result might or might not be close to what you had in mind. If you are not providing a lot of details, the AI can decide what to do and sometimes it's close to what you had in mind, but often it isnt'.


Now try this prompt:

::: prompt
Write R code that generates a dataset of 100 individuals with ages from 18 to 49, BMI values from 15 to 40 and smoking status as yes or no. Assume that age and BMI are uncorrelated. Assume that smokers have a somewhat lower BMI. Then use the patchwork R package to generate a panel of ggplot2 plots. The first panel should show a violin plot with BMI on the y-axis and smoking status on the x-axis. The second panel should show a scatterplot with age on the y-axis and BMI on the x-axis. Add thorough documentation to your code.
:::

When I gave the second prompt to ChatGPT 3.5, it gave me this [fully working code](../../code/chatgpt-example.R). It is possible that when you try this, the code will look slightly different. Remember, these AI tools are not fully deterministic and can produce different results each time. Hopefully, what you get will run. If not, you might need to either fix the code or ask the AI to fix it (we'll look at that in another unit).


As you can see, good prompts are often quite long. It makes sense to write those down outside the AI first. That also helps somewhat with reproducibility. I generally try to stick AI prompts at the top of my R/Quarto files, or into a separate file.

You also notice that for the second prompt, I had to know more about the programming language, for instance I had to know that there is a package called `ggplot2` and one called `patchwork`. 

You will find that the more you know in general about a topic, the more useful those AI tools become. That means that you still have to learn some coding (or whatever the topic is) and understand it enough on a big picture level to be able to be useful. But you don't necessarily need to be an expert.

An analogy I like is that of a composer. A composer needs to know enough about the various instruments of an orchestra to be able to write music for each instrument. But they don't need to be able to play each instrument. Similarly, you need to know enough about coding or whatever the topic is you are working on to _compose_ prompts for the AI and evaluate what it produces, but you don't necessarily need to be an expert coder.


# Iterating

It's rare that you get exactly what you want from the AI with your first prompt. Quite likely, you realize that you weren't specific enough, or that you really wanted something slightly different but didn't properly specify it in the prompt. Often, the code might also not quite work. The AI might have just made up a package or function that doesn't exist, or otherwise introduced mistakes. 

While it would be nice to get a great product on the first try, the process is so fast that it doesn't matter much. Just try again. You can either update your prompt and feed it to the AI again. Or you can tell it what changes you want to make. Try this as a starting prompt:

::: prompt
Write R code that generates a dataset of 100 individuals, half of them female, with ages from 18 to 49, weight from 100 to 500 pounds and BMI from 15 to 35. Make a figure that shows weight on the x-axis, BMI on the y-axis, and stratification by sex. Add thorough documentation to the code.
:::


When I fed that to Bing in "precise" mode it produced [this code](../../code/bing-iterate-example.R). Note that it didn't really give me an R script, I copied what it produced into an R file.

The code runs and produces a figure, but there are problems. Right now, the data is generated assuming each variable is independent of the other. We know that weight is strongly correlated with BMI, since it's part of the equation defining BMI. We also know that males are generally heavier. We can easily fix this. One approach is to update your prompt and make it more explicit, such as: 

::: prompt
Write R code that generates a dataset of 100 individuals, half of them female, with ages from 18 to 49, weight from 100 to 500 pounds and BMI from 15 to 35. Assume that males are generally somewhat heavier than females. Also assume thet BMI and weight are positively correlated, based on the definition of BMI. Make a figure that shows weight on the x-axis, BMI on the y-axis, and stratification by sex. Add thorough documentation to the code.
:::

With this updated prompt, I got [this code](../../code/bing-iterate-example-update1.R), here are the relevant bits

::: output
```
# Generate a dataset of 100 individuals
data <- data.frame(
  # Generate sex variable with half of them female
  sex = rep(c("male", "female"), each = 50),
  
  # Generate ages from 18 to 49
  age = sample(18:49, 100, replace = TRUE),
  
  # Generate weight values from 100 to 500 pounds
  # Assume that males are generally somewhat heavier than females
  weight = c(runif(50, min = 100, max = 400), runif(50, min = 200, max = 500)),
  
  # Generate BMI values from 15 to 35
  # Assume that BMI and weight are positively correlated
  bmi = c(runif(50, min = 15, max = 25), runif(50, min = 25, max = 35))
)
```
:::

There are several issues. It labeled the first 50 individuals as males, but assigned them the lighter instead of heavier weight. It also didn't properly create BMI values as function of weight.

We could of course modify the prompt above further, trying again. Or we can directly iterate at the prompt and ask the AI to update the code. Here is an example:

::: prompt
Update the code such that males and females are randomly distributed, make sure that males are on average heavier than females, and compute values for BMI as a function of weight with some random variation added.
:::

With this updated prompt, I got [this code](../../code/bing-iterate-example-update2.R), here are the relevant bits

::: output
```
# Generate a dataset of 100 individuals
data <- data.frame(
  # Generate sex variable with males and females randomly distributed
  sex = sample(rep(c("male", "female"), each = 50)),
  
  # Generate ages from 18 to 49
  age = sample(18:49, 100, replace = TRUE),
  
  # Generate weight values from 100 to 500 pounds
  # Make sure that males are on average heavier than females
  weight = ifelse(sex == "male", runif(50, min = 300, max = 500), runif(50, min = 100, max = 300))
)

# Compute values for BMI as a function of weight with some random variation added
# Assume a height of 1.75 meters for simplicity
# BMI = weight(kg) / height(m)^2
# Convert weight from pounds to kg (1 pound = 0.453592 kg)
data$bmi <- (data$weight * 0.453592) / (1.75^2) + rnorm(100)
```
:::

That looks better. However, when you try to run it, you'll find that it doesn't work. The problem is that it tries to use the variable `sex` before that data frame is defined. So we need to fix that code. We could of course do it by hand, but we can also see if we can get the AI to fix its own code. Which brings us to the next unit, [read on there](../ai-fix-code/ai-fix-code-R).



# Summary

LLM AI are very helpful at assisting with writing code. You need to know exactly what you want and the more specific your prompt, the better. Rarely do you get exactly what you want on the first try, but iterating is easy and fast.

It is usefyul to write down your prompts so can go back to them later (and readers, including your future self, can see what you did).

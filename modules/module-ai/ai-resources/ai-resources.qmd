# Overview
This unit consists mainly of a collection of links to AI resources that might be useful. I tried to group them into themes and provide a bit of commentary. The focus is on generative AI tools.

# Learning Objectives
By the end of the unit, you should:

* Be aware of a few places where you can learn more about AI.


# Introduction




# AI in general

* [One Useful Thing](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/) is a Substack blog by Ethan Mollick where he discusses ideas around (generative) AI from a very applied user perspective. I read his writings regularly, and you might find a lot of what he wrote echoed in my writing, because that's where I get the ideas from `r emoji::emoji('grin')`.


* [Unconfuse Me](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Podcast) is a podcast by Bill Gates that covers all kinds of topics, but has a few interesting AI-themed ones, namely (as of this writing) episodes 2 and 5.

* [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) is a platform/company that offers a lot of teaching material related to AI. Some of the materials are free.



# AI and teaching

-   [Ethan Mollick's blog](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/) has a lot of
    generally useful information on AI use.

- [Wharton Interactive](https://interactive.wharton.upenn.edu/teaching-with-ai/) is an initiative by Ethan and Lilach Mollick and colleagues at Wharton that - among other things - looks at the use of AI for teaching and learning. The website contains some interesting ideas and links to papers that look further into AI use.

This section contains almost all of the content, organized into modules. Each module has several units. 

Assessments for each module are in the separate [Assessments section](../courseinfo/assessments-overview.qmd). 

The [Schedule page](../courseinfo/course-schedule.qmd) lists what content is covered and what assessments you need to do each week.

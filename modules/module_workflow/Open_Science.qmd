# Overview

In this unit, we'll talk a bit more about reproducible research, and how that fits into the much larger concept of "open science."



# Learning Objectives

* Understand the general idea of open science
* Explain what makes research reproducible and/or replicable
* Know what FAIR data standards are

# Introduction

Way back at the [beginning of the course](../module_intro_tools/Tools_Reproducibility.qmd),
we briefly discussed reproducibility. Throughout the course, we emphasized the importance to do analyses in a reproducible (and thus generally automated/scripted) manner. In this module, we'll discuss a bit more what reproducible research means and entails, current trends towards open science, and why you pretty much need to have a solid grasp on reproducible research strategies in the future. 


# Federal open science requirements

While the concepts of reproducible research and open science have been around for a while, they have recently increased in prominence.
Several US government organizations have said that [2023 is the Year of Open Science](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/news/year-of-open-science), and a recent
Office of Science and Technology Policy [memo](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/08/25/ostp-issues-guidance-to-make-federally-funded-research-freely-available-without-delay/) has recommended that all federal agencies take serious steps towards open science practices (more on what exactly
this means later).

Federal agencies like the NIH have been requiring data sharing and public
releases of papers (on PMC) for some time now, but these recommended measures
are even stronger, and in my opinion, a very positive direction for science.
It is quite likely that if you work with federal funding in the near future,
you will be required to share your data and code publicly as soon as you
decide to publish. The exact implementation of these protocols hasn't been
determined yet (nor has the degree to which these recommendations will be
formally implemented), but the writing is on the wall, so to speak.

**It is easier for you to get comfortable with reproducible research methods
and open science now, rather than scrambling to learn it in the future!**

# The general idea of open science

There are many ways of defining and describing "open science".

If you search online for "what is open science," you will likely find various conceptual diagrams and descriptions. The papers [*Open science saves lives: lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic*](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-021-01304-y) 
and [*From Open Data to Open Science*](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020EA001562)
provide pretty good conceptual discussions of open science, but I think the
best of schematic summary is from [NASA](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/open-science/oss-for-eso-workshops).

![Source: [NASA](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/open-science/oss-for-eso-workshops)](../../media/open-science.jpg){width="50%" fig-alt="A circular graphic with 'open science' in the center, showing several components of open science around it ([source](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/open-science/oss-for-eso-workshops))."}

NASA defines three components that are central to open science.

1. Accessible -- your research process and results need to be transparent. Open access,
FAIR data, and code sharing all fall into this.
2. Reproducible -- other people should be able to get the same results as you,
and you should strive to make reusable products.
3. Inclusive -- if your research is only accessible and reproducible for
relatively well-off scientists at major institutions in the USA, it's still
not really open üôÇ.

If you want a formal definition of "open science," here's the one from the
OSTP, which is pretty comprehensive:

> ‚ÄúThe principle and practice of making research
products and processes available to all, while
respecting diverse cultures, maintaining security
and privacy, and fostering collaborations,
reproducibility, and equity.‚Äù

Open science is like spaghetti sauce--it has a lot of ingredients that have to be cooked together to get the best flavor. 
Let's go into a bit more detail on each of these topics.

# Accessibility and FAIR data

Open access publishing is a big topic, but for the purposes of this class
I will just say that I think you should publish Open Access whenever possible.
While you're a student at UGA, [our library has a fund](https://www.libs.uga.edu/openaccessfund)
that can help you with this. In the future, it seems likely that any federally
funded projects in the US will require an open access fund as part of the budget,
as publishing OA can often be prohibitively expensive. If you want to learn
more, check out the [Wikipedia page on Open Access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access),
or if you *really* want to learn more, see [Peter Suber's book on OA](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/10752204/9780262517638_Open_Access.pdf).

The main purpose of this section is to talk about data sharing. Data sharing
used to be a pretty contentious topic, but fortunately it is more normalized
now than it has ever been before, and thanks to NIH (and other agency mandates),
it will likely be a normal part of science before too long.

Of course just dumping messy data without any documentation into a depository is not great
for accessibility and reproducibility. As some of you noticed during this
course, even data from the CDC or other reputable organizations is often
very poorly formatted and does not have a lot of metadata or documentation
to help you out. To somewhat solve this issue, the FAIR data
standards was created. FAIR stands for:

1. **F**indable: when someone goes to your paper or project, they should be
able to easily get to the data source.
2. **A**ccessible: users need to be able to access the data, and data are stored
in a way that users can feasibly get them.
3. **I**nteroperable: data should be in standardized formats, using standard
vocabulary. You should be specific if your data is derived from another dataset
or if the user will need other related datasets.
4. **R**eusable: data should be documented and version-controlled when you
release it, with clear descriptions of what information is contained in the
data, who can use the data, and for what purposes.


The FAIR standard was originally described in this [2016 publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618).
Another great resource is the [GO FAIR initative](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/). It is worth taking a short look at both these resources.

Of course dealing with things like data use agreements and individual privacy
is paramount, so 100% achieving these goals all the time is not feasible.
Sometimes you might need to use [synthetic data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_data)
based on your real data, or remove certain information from your data to protect
privacy, or require a data use agreement before you can distribute the
data to individuals. We should strive for data to be as FAIR as possible,
but protecting individual privacy is equally important!

In general, a lot of authors still hide behind "I can't share my data, it's confidential" as an excuse for not having to share. Most of the time, it is possible to share de-identified data without confidentiality problems. Hopefully, the near future will make data sharing much more common and also easier.


# Reproducibility (and replicability too)

We discussed **reproducibility** in [our previous reading](../module_intro_tools/Tools_Reproducibility.qmd), revisit it if you need a refresher.
In one sentence, *your research is reproducible if another scientist can repeat your methods on your data and get the same results.* That is, someone
else can take your code and data, rerun all your code, and get the same answers that you got in your paper.

An important and related issue is **replicability** -‚Äî you've probably heard of
the "replication crisis" in science. If not, see for instance this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis). 
In one sentence, *your research is replicable if someone else can follow your methods and materials to collect new data, analyze their data, and get similar results*. 
Of course in social and semi-social sciences (like epidemiology), when your results often
depend on the target population of interest and are expected to vary over
time, replicability can be a bit more nuanced than in an experimental
field, where experiments should pretty much control for anything that you
aren't interested in.

Note that replicability is somewhat related to the analysis topic of generalizability/portability we discussed. The difference is that we focused on analysis approaches that would lead to replicable modeling/analysis results using other data sources. More broadly, one wants to be able to replicate overall findings if one were to repeat the full study, including collection of new data. This is important, but for purposes of analysis, the data is considered given, and the focus is on reproducibility/replicability of the data analysis part.



# Inclusivity

The topic of inclusivity in data science is heavily tied into the idea of
data ethics -- critical thinking about the potential results and consequences
of the products we create is crucial in data science. Many of you have some public health training, and are therefore likely familiar with the [Belmont Report](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html).

Regardless of your scientific background, when working with data (especially
human subjects data), the guiding principles of respect for persons, beneficience, and justice
should be critical considerations for all of our research.

# Practical considerations

It is all nice and good to tell people that their data needs to be FAIR, and that their science needs to be open. But the question is, why do it? Most people might agree that there are societal benefits. For instance having a resource like GenBank for genetic sequences has allowed many scientists beyond those who created the original sequence to use the data and answer important scientific questions. However, there generally need to also be benefits for individuals to entice them to spend time following Open Science standards. This is happening increasingly. On one hand, tools to do research in an Open Science framework are getting increasingly better. For instance the whole `R` + `Quarto` framework we've been using in class makes it rather easy to do things automated and reproducible. Many other similar tools and resources are becoming available. Another potential benefit of Open Science is increased visibility. If others can use your data and models, they will likely cite your work. They might even want to collaborate with you. It seems for those individuals who are good at sharing, the benefits outweigh the perceived risks (such as "being scooped"). And the final, ever increasing "benefit" is that publishers and funding agencies increasingly require it. So if you don't follow Open Science standards, it might soon get hard to publish work or get funding. It's less of a "benefit" and more of an "avoid the penalties" thing, but regardless, it is an important practical consideration. 


# Further reading

Everything we discussed throughout this course, and this short introduction, hopefully conveyed the message that Open Science is an important topic to think about and strive toward. 
The importance of the topic has been increasing in recent years. It is useful to stay somewhat informed. Here are a few places you can find more open science resources.

* The Center for Open Science, a nonprofit dedicated to promoting open science
practices and community change, maintains [a blog](https://www.cos.io/blog)
with several thought provoking readings.
* Statistician Andrew Gelman sometimes writes about open science, mostly from
a statistical perspective and has some nice comments on replication.

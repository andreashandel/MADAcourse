# Overview

In this unit, we will continue the topic of dealing with data prior to
the actual statistical analysis.

While there were separate modules for *finding and wrangling* and
*visualizing* data, I want to remind you of this diagram:

Below the spiral an arrow points from Model to Report. An rounded arrow points from Model and Report back up to the spiral with the word Repeat."}

Different data-analysis related tasks rarely happen in a linear
sequence. Instead there is a general stage before statistical analysis
where you *mess* with your data (that's a technical term üòÅ) to get
ready for the main formal analysis. And often, as you start that formal
analysis, you'll have to go back and do some more cleaning/exploration.

# Learning Objectives

-   Learn how to explore your data
-   Become familiar with preliminary analyses

# Descriptive analysis

Before any statistical analysis, you should summarize and describe your
data. Only some of that will end up in a finished product (e.g., a paper
or a report), but it's important that you do it thoroughly and
exhaustively to ensure you fully understand your data and thus know what
statistical approaches are and are not appropriate.

Descriptive analyses generally consist of making tables and figures that
explore and summarize the data. Generally, you start with one variable
at a time, and likely focus on the most important ones first. That means
first you look at your outcomes of interest, then your main
predictors/exposures of interest, then as much as feasible at all other
variables. For continuous variables, you can use summary statistics
(e.g., the `summary` command in R) or histograms (e.g. the `hist`
command). For categorical variables, you can look at tables (e.g. the
`table` command) or barplots (e.g. the `barplot` command). The idea is
to see if anything unusual or interesting is going on. You might notice
problems with the data (e.g., a person with a negative weight) that need
cleaning. You might find that you have a categorical variable with a lot
of categories that contain only a few entries and only a few categories
with a lot of entries (e.g., religion could be such a variable). You
might want to flag that for further processing (we'll talk about that in
the next unit).

Once you've explored each variable by itself, you can start looking at
combinations. For instance plots with each outcome of interest on the
y-axis and each main predictor on the x-axis could be of interest.
Depending on the type of variable for the outcome or predictor
(continuous, categorical, etc.), you might want different types of
plots, as discussed in the visualization module. Tables are possible
too.

Further figures of interest might be correlation plots which show
correlations between all predictors in your data and might indicate
potential issues you need to address before fitting statistical models.
For instance if you have height, weight, and BMI in your data, you know
that BMI does not have independent information (it's a combination of
height and weight), and thus these variables are perfectly correlated.
Many -- though not all -- statistical models don't like such strongly
correlated variables, so you might need to decide to remove some
strongly correlated data beforehand. We'll talk about that more.

# Preliminary/exploratory statistical analysis

Sometimes, it is useful to start running some simple models on your
data. Sometimes, such models will become part of the main analysis, but
often they are just used to help explore the data. For instance if you
have two continuous variables and make a scatterplot, adding a linear
regression line through the data might be helpful to see if there is a
pattern. That is easily done if you make your figure with `ggplot2`, as
you can just add a stats geom to it.

You could also explore your data by running simple bivariate statistical
models, e.g. by fitting each predictor individually to the outcome of
interest. We won't talk much about standard regression approaches in
this class, but I'm sure you are familiar with standard statistical
tests that can be applied to two variables, depending on the types of
variables (linear regression, t-test, etc.).

**A note of caution: It is ok (in my opinion) to use standard
statistical tests and readouts (e.g., p-values) to guide main model
choices and as suitable, to report them in a final product. It is
however *only* ok to interpret p-values in the hypothesis testing sense
if you predefined the hypothesis and the full data generation and
analysis protocol. Outside a clinical trial, that's almost never done,
thus pretty much any reported p-value you see in the literature is
improperly used/interpreted.** Everyone does it, and pretty much
everyone does it wrong. The state of affairs when it comes to
statistical literacy, even among PhD holders, is still sad...

# Further reading

(Re)read the Exploratory Data Analysis and Using Models to Explore Your
Data chapters (4 and 5) in [*The Art of Data science
(ADS)*](https://leanpub.com/artofdatascience) book*.* We looked at that
book previously. You don't need to work/code along. But if you want to,
see the [**Some practice section of the Data Analysis
Overview**](../module_data_analysis/Data_Analysis_Overview.qmd#sec-some-practice)
page for some details on how to do it.

Also go through the rather short EDA tutorial which is part of the
[Visualize Data Posit Recipes](https://posit.cloud/learn/recipes).

The whole [*R4DS* book](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) focuses on the early
stages of data analysis, including exploration. There is whole section
called Explore and a chapter called Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). I
like this sentence from the beginning of their chapter: *E*DA is not a
formal process with a strict set of rules. More than anything, EDA is a
state of mind. That's a very good way to put it. Skim through that
chapter of *R4DS* (it's very similar to the Posit EDA Recipe). And of
course the rest of the book also provides lots of useful information on
that topic.

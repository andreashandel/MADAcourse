# Overview

This unit discusses how to do cross-validation and similar approaches using R.


# Learning Objectives

* Understand the concept of overfitting.
* Know that a model should generally be assessed by its performance with independent data.


# Introduction

We previously discussed cross-validation and train/test splitting from a conceptual level.
Here' well be looking at some examples on how to implement these in R.

We'll focus on the `tidymodels` set of packages.


To do the train/test split in R, you can use the [`rsample` package](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/) which is part of `tidymodels`.

Cross-validation works for most situations and is quite robust. It is also fairly easy to implement. In R, the `tidymodels` framework allows for easy CV, and we'll make use of that.

# Overview

In this unit, we will very briefly cover discriminant analysis, which is
a set of machine learning/statistical models that is very useful for
classification.

# Learning Objectives

-   Be familiar with discriminant analysis models.
-   Understand advantages and disadvantages of these kinds of models.

# Introduction

While logistic regression is the most widely used approach for
classification, it has several limitations. For one, it doesn't easily
generalize to outcomes that have more than 2 categories. Also, for
certain types of data, logistic regression might not perform very well.
Other methods like tree-based models, KNN or SVM can be used for
multi-category outcome classification and often provide good
performance. Another option are Discriminant Analysis (DA) methods.
Those approaches are fairly quick and easy to implement and fit. At
times, they provide better performance than logistic regression and
might do as well as more complicated models.

# General Idea behind DA

DA make assumptions about the distributions for each predictor, and then
uses those distributions to model and predict the outcome. This is
called a *generative* approach.

There are different forms of DA. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is
the simplest approach, it assumes that predictors can be modeled with a
multivariate normal distribution. Nonlinear discriminant analysis
approaches, e.g., quadratic DA, allow for a more flexible distribution
of the predictors. This makes the model more flexible, but also bigger
(so possibly more prone to overfitting). One can show that LDA and
logistic regression are mathematically rather similar (see e.g. the ISLR
book). Other nonlinear variants of DA exist, e.g. regularized, mixture,
flexible, ...

As for any model, there is always a
bias-variance/underfitting-overfitting trade-off between less flexible
approaches like LDA and more flexible approaches like some of the
nonlinear DAs.

# Strengths and Weaknesses of DA

A nice feature of DA is that it is one of the algorithms that allows for
classification with more then 2 outcomes. For two outcomes, there are
situations where logistic regression struggles (if the outcomes are
well-separated), and DA might perform better.

DA models are not as common as logistic regression, thus it might
require a bit more explanation to your audience if you decide to use
them. Also, DA models make assumptions about the distributions of the
predictors. If those assumptions do not hold, DA might not perform well.
In situations where logistic regression works well, it usually performs
better. Like logistic regression, DA is used for classification, not
regression.

# DA in `tidymodels`

`tidymodels` has the [`discrim`
pacakge](https://discrim.tidymodels.org), which implements several forms
of discriminant analysis.

# Further Resources

[Chapter 4 of *ISLR*](https://statlearning.com/) discusses discriminant
analysis. So does the *Generative Models* section in the [Examples of
Algorithms chapter in
*IDS*](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/examples-of-algorithms.html).

# Quiz

Get the quiz sheet for this module from the general
[**Assessments**](../../courseinfo/assessments-overview.qmd) page. Fill it
in, then submit to the online grading system before the deadline.

# Discussion

Write a post in this week's discussion channel that addresses this
topic:

*Now that we've essentially reached the end of the course and did the
whole data-analysis pipeline, which specific topics in the data-analysis
workflow do you still find unclear/confusing? Which ones do you wish we
had covered more? Are you looking for further resources on a specific
topic and haven't found anything good?*

Post by Wednesday, then comment on each others posts. I hope this
discussion will allow us to point each other to further possibly helpful
resources and maybe help clarify some still open questions.

And just to re-iterate: I very much welcome contributions to the course
pages, so if you have resources you think should be added, or sections
that are unclear and you can improve, please contribute! By now you know
how to do that: Fork the course repo, make changes, send a pull request.
I'll take a look, if things look good I'll merge. And of course I'll add you
to the *Acknowledgments* section of the course üòÑ.



# Exercise

## Overview

For this exercise, we will join the R data science community and participate in **Tidy Tuesday**, a weekly exercise that allows you to practice playing with data. The focus for Tidy Tuesday is on getting, cleaning (i.e., tidying) and exploring a data set, though people sometimes do statistical analyses as well. We'll do a "full" analysis workflow.

This is a solo exercise and will go into your portfolio.

## What is Tidy Tuesday

You briefly encountered Tidy Tuesday before in the [**Data Analysis Motivation unit**](../module-data-analysis/data-analysis-motivation.qmd). If you can't remember, revisit that unit and re-read that section. Also read the information at the provided links.

If you want to see another Tidy Tuesday example, see [one I did](https://www.andreashandel.com/posts/2019-10-02-tidy-tuesday-exploration/index.html), as part of a previous version of MADA. 

For even more examples of previous analyses, see this [Shiny app](https://nsgrantham.shinyapps.io/tidytuesdayrocks/) which scans twitter for posts mentioning `#tidytuesday`. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be updated/maintained anymore. But you can still find people on social media posting links to their Tidy Tuesday creations (feel free to share yours as well).

::: note
Apparently, there is now also a [Tidy Tuesday podcast](https://www.tidytuesday.com/). I'm not familiar with it, so I'm not sure what it's all about and if it is worth checking out. It probably is worth giving it a try, since it's (almost) always good to check out new things üòÅ and those are very short recordings, so I think they just introduce the data of the week. If you end up listening to some, let me know what you think.

## Your Tidy Tuesday Exercise

Your assignment is to participate in Tidy Tuesday by analyzing this week's dataset. You can start as soon as the dataset is posted, which is Mondays. The [datasets are released on GitHub](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). As I'm writing this, I have no idea what the data will be the week this exercise happens. That's part of the fun of it üòÑ.

Here are some more detailed instructions:

Use your portfolio website. Make sure it's up to date and fully synced. Open it in R Studio. Then open the `tidytuesday-exercise.qmd` file. That's where you'll write your Tidy Tuesday analysis.

Go to the [TidyTuesday Github repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). Look for the dataset for this week, and read the instructions on how to get the data. You will also be provided with a data dictionary. If the data is available for download, place it somewhere in your portfolio repository (e.g., in a new folder called `data`). **Remember the data limit for Git/GitHub, don't place files that are too large into your repo!**

## What you need to include

Write a Quarto file (with R code as part of the Quarto file or in a separate file) that loads the data, performs any needed cleaning and wrangling, does some EDA, and fits some models. Here are the details:

1.  Load, wrangle and explore the data. The EDA part involves making tables/figures to get an idea what your data is about. By now you know this is an
    iterative procedure, so it's ok to have these parts of the
    process/code intertwined.

2.  Once you understand the data sufficiently, formulate a
    question/hypothesis. This will determine your outcome of interest
    and, if applicable, main predictor(s) of interest. Since we don't
    know the data yet, it might be that the question is a bit contrived
    and not actually too interesting, but I'm sure there will be more
    than one potentially reasonable question one can ask, no matter what
    the data will be.

3.  Once you determine the question and thus your outcome and main
    predictors, further pre-process and clean the data as needed. Then
    split into train/test. (It might be that the data is too small for
    this split to make sense *in real life* but for this exercise, we'll
    just do it.)

4.  Fit at least 3 different model types to the data using the
    `tidymodels` framework we practiced. Use the CV approach for model
    training/fitting. Explore the quality of each model by looking at
    performance, residuals, uncertainty, etc. All of this should still
    be evaluated using the training/CV data. You can of course recycle
    code from previous exercises, but I also encourage you to explore
    further, e.g. try different ML models or use different metrics. You
    might have to do that anyway, depending on the data and your
    question/outcome.

5.  Based on the model evaluations and your scientific
    question/hypothesis, decide on one model you think is overall best.
    Explain why. It doesn't have to be the model with the best
    performance. You make the choice, just explain why you picked the
    one you picked.

6.  As a final, somewhat honest assessment of the quality of the model
    you chose, evaluate it (performance, residuals, uncertainty, etc.)
    on the **test data**. This is the only time you are allowed to touch
    the test data, and only once. Report model performance on the test
    data.

7.  Summarize everything you did and found in a discussion. Make sure
    you discuss your findings with regard to your original
    question/hypothesis. What did you learn? If feasible, show a summary
    figure or table that illustrates your main scientific finding from
    this analysis.

::: note
Remember to add ample information/documentation in the form of both code comments
and explanatory text You should provide a running commentary on what you
do, why you do it, and how your R code accomplishes that (so that if you
stare at it in a few weeks, you can remember what in the world you did
back then üòÑ).
:::

## Finish up

Once done with your Tidy Tuesday analysis, rebuild your portfolio site
to make sure everything works and looks good, that all the links work,
etc. Then push to GitHub by the deadline. Since this will be on your
portfolio website, and I know where to find it, there is no need to post
any link.

And you just completed all the exercises for MADA! Now would also be a good time to check all of your portfolio page and further clean up/improve. This website is a nice showcase of what you've done and learned in this course, and something you can show to others (future employers, etc.). So I suggest you make sure it looks reasonably good and presentable. Here are some specific steps you should check.


# Portfolio website improvements

## Connecting website and file repository

First, let's make sure it's easy for people to go from your portfolio
website (the `github.io` location) to your file repository (the
`github.com` location) and back. To that end, open the `_quarto.yml`
file. At the bottom, it says `URL-TO-THIS-REPOSITORY-HERE`. Replace that
with the URL to your Github repository. As an example, for the MADA
course, the URL one would put in there is
`https://github.com/andreashandel/MADAcourse` (while the website lives
at `https://andreashandel.github.io/MADAcourse/`).

Once you done that, when people now are on your website, they can click
on the `Github` icon in the top right corner and be taken to your file
repository. Try to make sure it works by rebuilding your website and
pushing to Github. It might take a minute or so and you might need to
hit refresh before it shows up on the website.

Now, let's connect the two in reverse. Open `Readme.md` and update the
text. This is what people see when they come to your github repository
for your portfolio (as opposed to the website). I recommend adding a
little bit of text and a link pointing users to the actual website. You
can look at the [Readme.md for this
course](https://github.com/andreashandel/MADAcourse) as an example. Edit
yours as you want.

You might also want to point to your website in the top right area of
your repository on Github.com. If you go to your repository on GitHub,
you should see an `About` section in the top right. If you click on the
gear symbol, there is a field in which you can enter the URL for your
website (the `github.io` location). It might already show as
pre-populated, but you have to actually manually enter it before it will
show. You can again see how that looks on the repository for this
course.

With this, it is easy for anyone (including yourself) to quickly switch
between the website and the file repository.


## Adding more content

You've added most "products" you generated as part of htis class to the portfolio website. If you
have created other noteworthy products, either as part of this course or
outside, feel free to add them to your website. By now you should know
how to do that. For instance, if you want to add your project, either
now or once its done, feel free to do so. It probably doesn't make sense
to put the whole project content inside the portfolio. Instead, take the
main product (e.g., the `manuscript` file), render it to html, and add
it to the website. Or create a new `project.qmd` file where you briefly
describe what you did and show a few highlights, and then provide a link
to your main project repository for those interested in looking at the
whole thing.


## Cleanup and Styling

At this point, it might be worth revisiting your already posted pages
and making sure everything looks as nice and professional as possible.

While the way we built the website has only limited ways of styling
things (unless you want to start changing CSS and HTML code), you can
still customize some. Feel free to play around and customize the look.
You can find a good bit of information in the Quarto documentation. If you
look into the repository for the MADA course, you will also see that I'm
using my own CSS file (called `MADAstyle.scss`). SCSS/CSS lets you style
websites. It's not hard to write CSS code, but it is its own thing. I
usually just search online to find what I'm looking for üòÅ. You
certainly don't have to, but if you want to further customize the look
of your website, you can add your own CSS file and style it how you
like.


## More Comments

Future employers really do look at portfolios like this, so being able
to showcase something nice and polished is useful. It is also part of
having a good online presence. I think for (future) professionals like
yourself, a solid online presence is vital. I have in the past discussed this with our grad students in another class, if you want to see my thoughts on that, you
can check out [my presentation on building your
brand](https://www.andreashandel.com/presentations/2021-01-building-your-brand/)
-- which is of course made with R Markdown and posted to a `Quarto`
based website üòÑ.

# Overview

For this unit, we will discuss different common formats for storing data.


# Learning Objectives

- Be familiar with common data storage formats.
- Know the advantages and disadvantages of different data storage formats.


# Open formats

It is generally a good idea to store your data in a format that is widely readable by most software.


## Text

Plain text is the most portable and easy to use format. Most code, no matter what the programming language is, is written and stored as text. The Quarto files you have been working on are also text. Text can be read by any text editor and can be modified easily. The major disadvantage is that it's not that suitable for storing potentially complex data.


## CSV

The CSV (comma-separated values) format is really just a text format that's very well suited for rectangular, spreadsheet-type data. In a CSV, you have rows and columns of entries, and the entries are separated by commas. CSV files are easily readable by most software. If you are storing information that contains commas as part of the values (e.g., if you are storing text in some columns), CSV files can be problematic. TSV files, which stands for tab-separated values, are a variation that uses a tab instead of a comma to separate entries, thus sometimes being more robust. Semicolons are also sometimes used to separate values.


## Compressed data

While CSV and text files are very easily readable formats, one major disadvantage of those files is that they can get relatively large. They don't store information in the most efficient manner. CSV files also can't store meta-information, for instance the fact that some variable encodes a date. In a CSV file, it's all just text.

There are formats that are more space-efficient and can preserve some meta-information. Examples are the `Rds` and `Rda` formats in R. For differences between those two formats, [see e.g. this article](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata). The disadvantage of this and similar formats is that they require specific software to read the data. As long as the data format and software needed is open and free, it's not that big of an issue, though sometimes it can hinder portability.


## Other open formats

Depending on the data type, there are other open formats for images, audio, video, web content, etc. As much as possible it is good to use formats that are open and follow some international standard. This makes it most likely that a wide variety of tools can work with these files, both in the present and the future.


# Proprietary formats

Proprietary formats are formats that are owned by some company. This fact means that the company can control and change the format, making data stored in those formats potentially less accessible.


## Excel

Excel has its own format for storing data. It is common enough that a lot of software can read Excel files. One problem with the Excel format is that the way the data is stored is not always how it looks when you open the file and look at the data, due to additional formatting that's encoded. This means you think you might have the data in one format, but really it's different once you load it into another software. Dates are good example where this can happen. 

If possible, it is safer to store information in CSV files. If you get data in Excel files, you'll ideally want to read it into another software - such as R - as quickly as possible.


## SAS/SPSS/STATA/etc.

Most commercial software has its own format of storing code and data. The problem with these formats is that you need the right software to read the data, and you often won't know what you are getting unless you can open the file with the right program. 


## Databases

At times, the data is so complex or large that it can't be stored in a single file. In such situations, data is often stored in databases. There are tons of types of databases in existence. SQL based databases are very common. Databases are a huge topic and definitely something worth learning about if you need to work with them. However, since there are so many types, it is best to learn 'as needed' about the specific database you plan on working with. 


# Summary

Plain text and CSV files are generally great options to store data that's not too large. For large or more complex data, you might need different formats. In general, using open and international standards is the best idea.

# Overview

At the heart of most data analyses is the step at which the data is brought into close contact with models. This is at times called the statistical analysis part, though often that term is also applied to the whole data analysis process. A more descriptive term is model fitting. The model is being fit to the data - what exactly that means and entails is the topic of this module.

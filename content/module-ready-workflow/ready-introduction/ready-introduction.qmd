# Overview

This unit provides an overview of the ideas for a data analysis that follows reproducible, efficient, automated, and documented (READy) principles.


# Learning Objectives

- Know the concept and importance of reproducible research


# Introduction

The concept of reproducible research or what I call here more generally the READy workflow, is becoming increasingly important. This unit provides a few general ideas on the topic, with further units going into more detail on specific aspects that can help you to perform READy analyses.

# Reproducibility and Replicability

A hallmark of proper scientific research is that findings can be replicated and/or reproduced. The terms **reproduciblity** and **replicability** are sometimes used interchangably, sometimes they are considered slightly distinct.

If they are differentiated, **replicability** is generally considered broader. In one sentence, *your research is replicable if someone else can follow your methods and materials to collect new data, analyze their data, and
get the same (or similar, taking into account some random variation) results*. 

Unfortunately, it is often the case these days that results can't be replicated/reproduced by independent investigators/labs. Sometimes, even the same labs can't reproduce their previous findings. You have probably heard about the (supposed) [*Reproducibility/Replication Crisis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis) in science. If not, do a quick online search, you'll find lots of articles saying there is an increasing problem, while others saying that it's not getting worse, we are just detecting more. While sometimes there is fraud, most often there are more benign reasons preventing reproducibility.

This video provides a short discussion of some of the current problems with reproducibility in science:

# Reproducibility of Analyses

The term replicability is generally applied to a full study, including the data collection part. It is hard and expensive to replicate/reproduce a full study, including all data collection, thus not routinely possible. It is easier to make sure the analysis part can be reproduced. Making the analysis easily reproducible doesn't ensure the analysis is correct. However, it allows others to take a look at analyses, redo them, and thus more quickly spot and correct potential problems.

To make a fully reproducible analysis, you have to provide all the data and code, and the generation of results (figures and tables) needs to be fully automated. The scientific community is moving toward more reproducibility and transparency (e.g., mandating public access to data, computer code, etc.). An increasing number of funding agencies and journals require access to data and code.

While there is a strong movement toward *Open Access*, providing all the data is not always possible. However, the full automation of data processing, analysis, and result generation is always possible.

In this video, [Roger Peng](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/) goes into some more details of the concept of reproducible research:

# Why reproducibility is good for you

A reproducible analysis is generally automated. That can save you a lot of time. Initially, it seems that doing your analysis in a reproducible and automated manner takes more time and is more difficult because you have to learn some new tools. That is true. However, once you are used to it, you will be much more efficient.

Consider the case where you had some data in Excel, moved it into SAS to do an analysis, and make some raw figures, opened them in Photoshop and spend a few hours making them look good. Then you or your collaborators realize that some of the data that should have been included in the analysis was not (or some data should not have been included). You need to re-create the raw figure and re-work it in Photoshop, likely spending a good bit of time.

If you had an automated analysis, you could just press one (or a few) buttons and re-run everything. Also, automation makes it less likely that errors occur from copying data and intermediate results between programs. The case-study in the introductory unit is such an example, where everything was fully automated.

Making an analysis reproducible also means you to document all your steps and what you do well. So it not only helps others, but *future you* will be very thankful. The importance of documenting the process increases, as analyses get more complex.



# How to do a reproducible analysis

For an analysis to be reproducible, it needs to be well-documented, generally also automated, and thus efficient. Therefore, those components go together and that's why I combined them under the READy acronym.

Do all processing and analysis in a scripted and well-documented manner. That means no Excel or similar tools should be used that don't leave a record of what is happening, no manual copy & paste, and no manual figure or table generation. These actions are not scripted or documented and as such, are not reproducible.

A reproducible analysis should also be *practically reproducible*, not just *theoretically*. By that I mean if you provide code, but the code only runs on some specific computer system you used, then it's not reproducible for others. Providing all data and code is a good first step, but your goal should also be to make reproducibility easy. This is beneficial for both the original producer of the results and the persons trying to reproduce it.

title: Assessment - READy Workflow
subtitle: ""

# Quiz

Get the quiz sheet for this module from the general [**Assessments**](../../courseinfo/assessments-overview.qmd) page. Fill it in, then submit to the online grading system before the deadline. 


# Discussion

Describe (at least) one feature of the READy workflow that you found surprising, or unintuitive or confusing, or something you think is missing or you can think of a alternative and possibly better way of doing things.

Then comment/reply to your classmates posts.


# Exercise

This project asks you to go through the steps of a simple data analysis. As you go about executing this small project, think about the READy concepts and implement them as suitable. This exercise also involves group work, and of course GitHub. 

**This exercise has staggered due dates, see below.**


## Group setup

As in the previous exercise, assign each member in your group a different, arbitrary number (I'm calling them M1, M2, ...). Make sure you are teamed up with a different person this time. For this exercise, everyone will first work on their own and finish this part by Wednesday. Then M1 will contribute to M2's repository, M2 will work on M3, etc. The last person (M3/M4/M5, based on the number of people in your group), will work on M1's repository. This way, everyone will work on their own and one group member's repository. 


## Part 1

You will be using another project template for this exercise (and the same one also for your class project). Go to the Github repository for the [data-analysis-template](https://github.com/ahgroup/data-analysis-template) and read the information in the `README.md` file (shown at the bottom of the repository website). You can ignore the bits about Package Management.

Then start a new repository using this template by clicking the green `Use this template` button on the top right of the repository page, then chose `Create a new repository`. Name the repository `FirstnameLastname-ready-exercise`. Make sure the repository is public. Add a description. Then create the repository. Once it has been created on GitHub.com, clone it to your local computer.

One you have a local version, open it in Positron an look at the different folders, files, and `readme.md` comments that you find inside the various folders. You should be able to run all the various R and Quarto scripts. The idea is that you get some familiarity with the whole setup to prepare you for the next steps.

Now go ahead and open the `exampledata.xlsx` file (with Excel or a similar program) located in the `raw-data` folder, and add 2 more columns to the data. One column should be something numeric, the other can be something consisting of (a few) different categories. As a (boring) example, you could add eye color and waist size. Feel free to come up with more creative attributes/variables to add. Also add descriptions of your new variables to the `Codebook` sheet/tab. Once done, save the new data as **`exampledata2.xlsx`**.

Then open the `starter-analysis-report.qmd` file, find the _Description of data and data source_ section and add a few sentences explaining what you added to the data sheet.


Commit your changes (write a meaningful commit message) and push them to GitHub.com.

**You need to have this done by Tuesday evening.**

### Part 2


Go into the `starter-analysis-exercise` folder and look at the `exampledata2.xlsx` file and information in `Codebook` to understand what new variables your classmate created.

Find `processingfile.qmd` inside `/code/processing-code/`, make a copy of the file, call it `processingfile2.qmd`. Update the code in `processingfile2.qmd` such that it now loads the new data file called `exampledata2.xlsx`. Take a look at the new data. Add code to clean the new data as needed. Have the code save the updated data to `processeddata2.rds`.

Next, open `eda.qmd` inside `/code/eda-code/` (EDA stands for exploratory data analysis). Make a copy, add code to the new file that creates a boxplot with the new categorical variable (whatever it is) on the x-axis, and height on the y-axis. Also create a scatterplot with weight on the x-axis and the new numerical variable on the y-axis. Save both figures to files.



**You need to have this done by Thursday evening.**

### Part 3



Next, find `statistical-analysis.R` inside `/code/analysis-code/`. Make a copy. Edit the code such that it fits a third linear model with `Height` as outcome and the 2 new variables as predictors. Save the result into `resulttable3.rds` into the appropriate results folder.

::: note
I'm sure you noticed that we switched from Quarto files to R scripts. I'm doing this to show you that either are fine. Sometimes it's better to combine code and text in one file. Sometimes just having code by itself is easier/better. In any case, you should add lots of comments and documentation to the Quarto or R file.
:::

Now we are ready to include the new findings. Open `starter-analysis-report.qmd` inside the `products/report` folder. 

At the top of the file, add a sentence stating something like **CLASSMATE NAME contributed to this exercise**. This needs to be there for me to be able to grade both your and their contribution.

Next, at the end of the document, add code to display the two new figures and the new table. Add a few sentences to each to explain what it shows and what it means.

Once all is done, fully rebuild your portfolio website. Commit and push your changes. Go to your website URL to make sure the updated page with the new figures included shows up under the Starter Analysis Exercise project entry.

**You need to have this done by Friday evening. Since this will be part of your portfolio site, and you already posted a link to that previously, you don't need to post anything, I know where to find it. I will assess both the contribution of the repository owner and the classmate who added to this.**


## Another *fork and pull* exercise

**This is optional. You can do it at any time during this course (and more than once) 😁.**

Help improve the course with your contributions! Find something wrong/unclear/worth improving with this course (e.g. a typo, something confusing, a broken link, a suggestion for a new reference, or anything else). Go to the [Github repository for this course](https://github.com/andreashandel/MADAcourse). Follow the steps outlined above: Fork the course to your personal account, clone it to your local computer, implement your updates, push it back to GitHub, then initiate a pull request. I will get a notification of your pull request. If things look ok and no conflicts exist, I will merge your improvements into the course. And just like that, you have contributed to improving this course! (And of course, you will be listed in the *Acknowledgments* section of the main course page.)

Another option for helping to improve the course website is to file a GitHub Issue. Feel free to do so any time during the course to let me know of anything that needs fixing.

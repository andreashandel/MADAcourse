# Overview

I started to write a unit on AI tools. Then it got too big üòÅ and I decided to make it its own module, which you can find towards the end of the content list sidebar. 

Please go through the content of [the AI module](../module-ai/ai-overview.qmd). You don't need to read through all of it this week, but do so soon. I strongly encourage you to use AI throughout this course, and you will be explicitly asked to do so in some of the exercises.
